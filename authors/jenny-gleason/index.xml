      <description>I am PhD candidate in the Integrative Biology department co-supervised by Karl Cottenie and Robert Hanner. My main research interests include community ecology and aquatic entomology, with an emphasis on freshwater ecosystems and bioindicator taxa. My PhD research focuses on the local and landscape-scale influence of agriculture on the composition of stream macroinvertebrate communities in southern Ontario. I am interested the relative importance of space and environment on the assembly of groups with different dispersal capabilities and feeding strategies.</description>
