      <description>Hi, my name is Kemp!
I started in the Cottenie lab in November 2017 and graduated a year later. While I was there, I researched the best places to take naps in the office and who had the best treats. I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing my next degree at the Lion&amp;rsquo;s Foundation of Canada, where I will hopefully graduate and take on a job helping a Canadian with a disability.</description>
