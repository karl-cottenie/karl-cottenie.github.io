      <description>I am an Associate Professor in Community Ecology at the Department of Integrative Biology and Associate Dean, Graduate Studies at the University of Guelph. I started out as an freshwater ecologist focusing on the interaction between local environmental processes and regional dispersal processes on zooplankton community composition. Along the way, I developed a strong interest in the applications of statistical (multivariate) analyses and R which led me to focus on analysing existing data sets and meta-analyses.</description>
