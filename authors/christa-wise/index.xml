      <description>I am a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in Zoology. My undergraduate thesis project looks to explore sources of variation in small-scale bird surveys using long-term data from the University of Guelph Arboretum Winter Bird Count. After working at The Arboretum as a naturalist intern, I jumped on the opportunity to connect my undergraduate thesis with The Arb, since it is an often undervalued research resource. These small-scale bird surveys give an intimate view of local bird population trends, and this project has the potential to provide improved protocols to increase consistency and reliability for these types of surveys.</description>
