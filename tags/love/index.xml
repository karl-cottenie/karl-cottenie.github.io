      <description>If I could meet any person, dead or alive, real or fiction, I think one of my top choices would be Steve Irwin. I&amp;rsquo;d want to meet him out in the bush, maybe in Australia, maybe help him re-locate a croc. Afterwards, we might talk about conservation and peace and wilderness. Or, more accurately, he&amp;rsquo;d talk, and I&amp;rsquo;d just nod vigorously in agreement while reveling in his radiance.
Steve Irwin is famously known for his larger-than-life television series Crocodile Hunter.</description>
