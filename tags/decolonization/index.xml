      <description>Karl recently cited this PNAS article in his blog post about the link between environment and society. I started reading it but could not get past the third sentence in the abstract; just those three sentences gave me plenty to think about.

Sentence 1: &amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;the human condition is tightly linked to environmental condition.&amp;rdquo;
I absolutely agree! E.g. The Forsaken Garden by Nancy Ryley - I just started reading this book, about a CBC documentary filmmaker who got struck with &amp;ldquo;environmental illness&amp;rdquo; in the 70&amp;rsquo;s at the height of her career.</description>
