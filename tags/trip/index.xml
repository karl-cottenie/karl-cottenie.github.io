      <description>I (Karl Cottenie) had a busy weeklong trip to Belem, Brazil, at the end of October. I was invited to facilitate a 2.5 day workshop, give a research seminar, and be part of an MSc qualifying defence.
See here for some pictures of my trip, and below is a little bit more information on what I did.
It was really fun (and a lot of work) to put together the material for the metacommunity workshop.</description>
