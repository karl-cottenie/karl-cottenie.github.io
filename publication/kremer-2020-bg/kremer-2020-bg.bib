 abstract = {The nuclear genomes of eukaryotes vary enormously in size, with much of this variability attributable to differential accumulation of transposable elements (TEs). To date, the precise evolutionary and ecological conditions influencing TE accumulation remain poorly understood. Most previous attempts to identify these conditions have focused on evolutionary processes occurring at the host organism level, whereas we explore a TE ecology explanation.},
