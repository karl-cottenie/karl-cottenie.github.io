Although it is clear that SETs are used by administrators for summative purposes, such as providing data to support personnel decisions, it is uncertain how instructors use them for formative development such as to inform overall teaching practice. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency and nature of SET use for formative purposes, to explore the perception of SET utility to inform teaching practice, and to determine how perception of SET utility might be improved to enhance its use in a formative context. Participants were all biological sciences instructors at a large, research-intensive University. This research was conducted in two phases, using a combination of focus groups, interviews, and a survey to yield both qualitative and quantitative data. We found that while instructors generally perceive that SET feedback has formative utility, and that most instructors have used SET feedback for formative purposes at some point, there are many elements of SET administration that they are dissatisfied with, and they suggest several ways in which SETs could be improved (such as allowing in class time for SET administration or doing multiple administrations per semester) to yield more useable feedback that could inform their teaching. The results of this study can be used to further inform the ongoing debate about the role that SETs should play in higher education, as they demonstrate both the utility and concerns about using SETs for formative purposes.","tags":null,"title":"Perception of Biology Instructors on Using Student Evaluations to Inform Their Teaching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca Zawalski","Weston H.

We examined the distribution of macroinvertebrates within the Guadalupe River basin (3256 km2) in Central Texas across physiographic gradients. Spatial analysis with variables that considers flow direction, connectivity and distances between sites (asymmetric eigenvector maps, AEM) detected distinctive communities in the lower reaches of the mainstem, in spring-influenced reaches, and in a tributary with intermittent reaches. Variation partitioning with redundancy analysis showed that large-scale factors, i.e. riverine network patterns (large-scale AEM variables), climatic variation and ecoregion explained a significant proportion (28%) of the variation in community composition within a river basin. The riverine network patterns were the most important factor, explaining 12% alone. Local environmental factors were significant, but completely confounded within these spatial patterns. We propose that there are distinctive macroinvertebrate communities depending on the location in the river network and this may apply to other (subtropical) rivers, which should be tested by future studies. We recommend spatial analysis that considers distances and connectivity within a river network as a powerful tool to recognize multiscale riverine network patterns, which can help to identify priority areas for conservation and to develop sound monitoring programs.","tags":["AEM spatial variables","aquatic insects","biogeography","biomonitoring","intermittent flow","metacommunity","springs"],"title":"Distinctive macroinvertebrate communities in a subtropical river network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua T.

Despite the importance of these species, knowledge of their abundance, distribution, and interactions with predators is often limited. On Middleton Island, Alaska, USA, we coupled biologging (GPS-depth logging) with long-term diet observations to examine the use of rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata chick diets as an ecologically relevant method to sample forage fish in the Gulf of Alaska. Individual rhinoceros auklets did not specialize on select prey items but did specialize on 1 of 2 foraging sites, foraging either in coastal waters or the continental shelf. The majority of forage fish in bill-loads were captured in the top 15 m of the water column. Prey composition in auklet bill-loads varied among and within sampling years (2003-2016). Capelin Mallotus villosus dominated auklet diets during the cold-water period with negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation values (2008-2013), whereas Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus were more common in warmer years. Bill-load composition changed within years, with sand lance and capelin delivered to younger chicks, and larger fish, like sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, being introduced as the chicks aged. Auklets returned with sand lance in foraging areas where trawling detected none, implying that auklets can potentially detect fish availability at finer resolutions than conventional methods. In conclusion, auklets responded to variation in forage fish among and across years. These changes in seabird diet could expand our knowledge of changes in availability of important prey species.","tags":["Capelin","Cerorhinca monocerata","Gulf of Alaska","Individual specialization","Seabird foraging"],"title":"Individual foraging location, but not dietary, specialization: implications for rhinoceros auklets as samplers of forage fish","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nAll IB graduate students should have received an email announcing the new batch of programs offered by the university to help graduate students with one of the most difficult academic skills: writing.\n\u0026ldquo;Dear Graduate Faculty, Coordinators, and Graduate students, Our analytics indicate that those students who receive writing instruction and consultation early in their graduate programs complete their degree requirements sooner. Our programs are designed for graduate student writers at all levels and stages. Individual Writing Consultations: (starts January 15).\u0026rdquo;The claims made at the start of the email (\u0026ldquo;Our analytics indicate [\u0026hellip;] complete their degree requirements sooner.\u0026ldquo;) are contrary to a recent publication that received some exposure: \u0026ldquo;Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences\u0026rdquo; by Feldon et al. 2017. The title already give the results away, but here is the main conclusion:\n\u0026ldquo;Here we show that participation in such programs is not associated with detectable benefits related to skill development, socialization into the academic community, or scholarly productivity for students in our sample.\u0026rdquo;\nThis study was no slouch, with 295 participating students, followed for several years with performances evaluated using standard rubrics, etc, and thus the pushback has been struggling with the quality of the study. For instance, the Software Carpentry organization, whose reason for existence is offering these workshops, responded to this almost existential threat in quite some detail. While I think I perceived an undertone of defensiveness in their response, I think that the easiest explanation for these null effects are identified by the Software Carpentry people:\n\u0026ldquo;Benefits of a short course are easily lost in a sea of positive outcomes resulting from graduate training, but that has little bearing on the impact such courses may have when they stand alone.\u0026rdquo;But that is of course also a sort of cop out. Although given that \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; 16% of the participants participated in such a workshop, the lack of detecting the influence of a single workshop in the wide range of personal outcomes is not that surprising. This is one of the cases where a post-hoc power analysis might have been informative.\nThe second, standard, scientific cop out is that the authors did not measure the correct outcome. The end point identified by the original notification email (time to completion) was very different from the the endpoints measured in the long-term study (productivity, academic skills development, socialization into the academic community).

Seventy-eight of 91 data sets showed a negative relationship between species richness and population variability; 46 of these relationships were statistically significant. Only five of the 13 positive richness-population variability relationships were statistically significant. Similarly, 51 of 91 data sets showed a negative relationship between species richness and community variability; of these, 26 were statistically significant. Seven of the 40 positive richness–community-variability relationships were statistically significant. We were able to test transferability (i.e., the predictive ability of models for sites that are spatially distinct from sites that were used to build the models) for 69 of 91 data sets; 35 and 31 data sets were transferable at the population and community levels, respectively. Only four were positive at the population level, and two at the community level. We conclude that there is compelling evidence of a negative relationship between species richness and temporal variability for about one-half of the ecological communities we examined.

Pulse responses were detected for three habitat variables quantifying vegetative cover: percent vegetation on the bank, percent in-stream vegetation, and percent cover. All three variables returned to pre-maintenance levels within two years of maintenance. No consistent changes were observed in the remaining habitat features or in the richness and densities of benthic invertebrate assemblages following drain maintenance.

To better understand how urban parks can be managed to maximize lichen biodiversity, we examined trees in seven parks throughout the City of Guelph in southern Ontario.

Murray, Pinus resinosa Aiton, and Pinus strobes L. We recorded the lichen species on 99 trees, calculated the pH and fissuring of the bark, and determined the diameter at breast height (DBH) as a proxy for age. Gamma diversity on all trees included 18 lichen taxa. We used graphite bark rubbings analyzed in ImageJ 1.47v to calculate the degree of bark fissuring. We collected bark samples from each tree trunk and determined the acidity with a pH meter. Using multivariate analyses we show that lichen community composition is positively correlated with DBH and tree species, but the degree of fissuring did not have a significant effect. We could not statistically analyze pH independent of tree species, but our results suggest pH is not a significant variable. We show lichen biodiversity in urban parks can be increased by planting a variety of tree species at different ages.","tags":["conservation","managed landscapes","restoration","urban biodiversity","urban forestry"],"title":"The effects of bark quality on corticolous lichen community composition in urban parks of southern Ontario","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Stephen Heard touched on a controversial issue in his latest blog post: Can we stop saying reviewers are unpaid?\u0026nbsp;This (contrarian?) point of view resulted in some push-back in the comments, and on other blogs (e.g. Let\u0026rsquo;s keep saying it, and say it louder: REVIEWERS ARE UNPAID by Mick Watson). I agree with most of Stephen Heard\u0026rsquo;s points, and also with his updated point \u0026ldquo;publishers (mostly) don\u0026rsquo;t pay for reviews\u0026rdquo;. Where I disagree with him (there has to be at least one disagreement, because why otherwise waste digital bandwidth on writing this?), is that \u0026ldquo;reviewers are (mostly) paid\u0026rdquo; is actually an important admission.\nI struggled to find a useful analogy to explain my unease with his admission, and it suddenly dawned on me. Several years ago, I read a blog post by Alex Bond on Why volunteer field techs are a bad idea. I hope I summarize their (further developed with Auriel Fournier in a\u0026nbsp;published opinion piece\u0026nbsp;that received a lot of\u0026nbsp;pushback) arguments\u0026nbsp;correctly with these points:\nit is an essential part of the research process, so it should be rewarded accordingly;not paying reduces the field tech\u0026rsquo;s value, and thus \u0026ldquo;the professionalism of science as a whole\u0026rdquo;;prevents underprivileged scientists from participating;financial restrictions, tradition, and CV building for the field techs are not good enough justifications in light of these criticisms.The analogy with peer review is immediately obvious in the first line: it is an essential part of the scientific process, so it should be rewarded. Stephen Heard\u0026rsquo;s argument is that reviewers are being rewarded (paid). What the analogy with volunteer field techs exposes, though, is that it is important to look at who benefits from the work. In the field tech case, it is first the scientist who got funding for the study that benefits from the volunteer work, and then in a second step science as a whole. In the peer review case, what I think Stephen Heard overlooks is that publishers benefit first, and science as a whole only in a second step.\u0026nbsp;\nAnd this benefit to publishers is important. A recent Science paper by Gretchen Vogel and Kai Kupferschmidt report on a quick back-of-the-envelop type of calculation:\u0026ldquo;Collectively, the world\u0026rsquo;s academic libraries pay some €7.6 billion in subscription fees for access to between 1.5 million and 2 million new papers annually, or between €3800 and €5000 per paper, according to an estimate by the Max Planck Society.\u0026rdquo;While the net benefit to the publishers will be lower, of course, nobody can argue that publishers do not benefit directly from the reviewers. And publishers do not pay reviewers, directly or indirectly. Yes, society as whole pays scientists partly for their many contributions, but eliminating the publishers from that argument is wrong. If we make the analogy with the volunteer field tech case again, that would be similar to imagining a PI flush with money saying that she will not pay her field tech because the \u0026ldquo;pay\u0026rdquo; provided by the experience will improve his CV and his changes for a scholarship or job. Or more succinctly: Volunteer field techs are (mostly) paid.\nIf that above scenario raises some problems, then arguing that reviewers are (mostly) paid, is not the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; statement to ponder. If you agree that in the above scenario that the field tech should receive monetary compensation for his contribution (or be paid) from the PI, and that that is the important debate, then I think that \u0026ldquo;reviewers should (also) be paid by publishers\u0026rdquo; is the more important debate to have.\n\n","date":1503594960,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503594960,"objectID":"ebf52c332aad2005621e9c93ae5a5be1","permalink":"/post/reviewers-should-also-be-paid-by-publishers/","publishdate":"2017-08-24T17:16:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reviewers-should-also-be-paid-by-publishers/","section":"post","summary":"Stephen Heard touched on a controversial issue in his latest blog post: Can we stop saying reviewers are unpaid?\u0026nbsp;This (contrarian?) point of view resulted in some push-back in the comments, and on other blogs (e.g. Let\u0026rsquo;s keep saying it, and say it louder: REVIEWERS ARE UNPAID by Mick Watson).

You need to be able to organize your thoughts, rethink experiments, present experimental results and interpretations and consider your next steps. These skills will make supervisor meetings less frightening and more useful.\u0026rdquo;So no mention of how the advisor can help the graduate student with the underlying causes of this fear? Because there are some clues scattered throughout the blog post:\n\u0026ldquo;The supervisor, with the best of intentions, provides constructive criticism\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;remarking on the slow progress of one PhD student\u0026rsquo;s research project at our second review meeting\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;Three months later, I repeated my concerns\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; I was too busy to notice for another six months.\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;I was horrified when my suggestion elicited tears.\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;Ideally, your supervisor will be empathetic until you can acclimatize to feedback and criticism\u0026rdquo;Maybe I am reading too much into these comments, but look at the accompanying artwork: towering, stern male figure vs cowering grad student. The student does not fear the criticism per se, but the supervisor.\nAnd how can we (supervisors, advisors, professors) create an environment that does not create this fear? This recent article reports on a survey done in an undergrad setting, but the conclusions are equally applicable to graduate advising, I think. Some of the facilitators are difficult to change or impractical (\u0026ldquo;Professor has good personality\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Professor gives their phone number\u0026rdquo;), and some of the suggested facilitators are behaviours that are difficult to quantify or change, such as encouraging, caring, inviting and open, willing or eager to help. But some suggestions are very practical and, if grad student interactions are important to you, relatively easy to implement (I added the bold to certain words):\n\u0026ldquo;Professor uses and answers email\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;Professor has many and flexible office hours\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;Professor has accessible office hours\u0026rdquo;And doing these things would show the student that you care.

Caddisfly larvae were sampled using a hierarchical spatial design in two regions (subarctic Churchill, Manitoba, Canada; temperate Pennsylvania, USA) and then additively partitioned according to Barcode Index Numbers (molecular clusters that serve as a proxy for species), genus, and family levels; diversity components were expressed as proportional species turnover. We screened 114 articles of additive diversity partitioning and found that a third reported difficulties with achieving species-level identifications, with a clear taxonomic tendency towards challenges identifying invertebrate taxa. Regarding our own study, caddisfly BINs appeared to show greater subregional turnover (e.g., proportional additive β) compared to genus or family levels. Diversity component studies failing to achieve species resolution due to morphological identifications may therefore be underestimating diversity turnover at larger spatial scales.","tags":["beta diversity","diversity components","DNA barcoding","spatial scales","Trichoptera"],"title":"The importance of taxonomic resolution for additive beta diversity as revealed through DNA barcoding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Linquist","T.

Detractors respond that this argument assumes an overly stringent definition of laws of nature. Under a more relaxed conception, it is argued that ecological laws emerge at the level of communities and elsewhere. A brief review of this debate reveals an issue with deep philosophical roots that is unlikely to be resolved by a better understanding of generalizations in ecology. We therefore propose a strategy for transforming the conceptual question about the nature of ecological laws into a set of empirically tractable hypotheses about the relative resilience of ecological generalizations across three dimensions: taxonomy, habitat type, and scale. These hypotheses are tested using a survey of 240 meta-analyses in ecology. Our central finding is that generalizations in community ecology are just as prevalent and as resilient as those in population or ecosystem ecology. These findings should help to establish community ecology as a generality-seeking science as opposed to a science of case studies. It also supports the capacity for ecologists, working at any of the three levels, to inform matters of public policy.","tags":null,"title":"Yes!

Coarse resolution may group together species with different environmental preferences, masking the relationship between taxonomic composition and environmental variables. Alternatively, closely related species often share similar traits, and therefore, refining taxonomic resolution will not affect, or even may decrease, the strength of relationships between taxa and environment. To test these competing hypotheses, we characterized the metacommunity patterns of 5 orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) and 1 subclass (Oligochaeta) of invertebrates in 21 streams in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. We determined community composition at family, genus, and species (DNA barcode cluster) levels. For each taxonomic level within each order, we computed the amount of variation explained by 20 local environmental and spatial variables. We also compared site diversity rankings, based on richness, Shannon index, and Simpson index values, between species–genus, genus–family, and species–family levels of resolution. We found evidence to support our 2nd hypothesis. Also, reducing taxonomic resolution decreased the consistency of site rankings for all 3 diversity indices. These results suggest the ecological interchangeability of species within genera, or even within families, given the environmental variables we measured. Furthermore, these results emphasize the importance of carefully considering taxonomic resolution for metacommunity work as well as biomonitoring.","tags":null,"title":"Taxonomic resolution based on DNA barcoding affects environmental signal in metacommunity structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuoru Liu","Gengxin Xie","Lizhu Wang","Karl Cottenie","Dongxiao Liu","Beixin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454302800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454302800,"objectID":"5c540505d9ac7a7716142afd08205ad4","permalink":"/publication/liu-2016-ei/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-2016-ei/","section":"publication","summary":"Exploring the relative contribution of spatial factors and environmental variables in shaping communities is of widespread interest in biodiversity conservation and environmental management. Stream communities are hierarchically regulated by environmental variables over multiple spatial scales, and the reaction of different organisms to stressors are still equivocal. We sampled both macroinvertebrates and diatom at 80 sites and additional 10 sites for macroinvertebrates, field measured and laboratory analyzed environmental variables, from the tributaries of Qiantang River, Yangtze River Delta China in 2011. We used PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) to generate spatial predictors. We applied redundancy analysis and variation partitioning procedures to identify key spatial and environmental factors, and to quantify their relative roles in shaping diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Our results demonstrated the role of spatial and environmental variables differed in shaping benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate. Diatom assemblage variations were better explained by spatial factors, however macroinvertebrate assemblage variations were better explained by environmental variables. In terms of environmental variables, catchment scale variables (e.g., land use estimators, land use diversity) played the primary role in determining the patterns of both diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages, whereas the influence of reach-scale variables (e.g., pH, substrates, and nutrients) appeared less. However, nutrients were the stronger factors influencing benthic diatom, whereas physical habitat (e.g., substrates) played more important role than water chemistry in structuring macroinvertebrates. Our results provided more evidence to the incorporation of spatial factors interpreting spatial patterns of stream organisms, and highlighted the useful of multiple organisms and environmental variables at different spatial scales in diagnosing mechanism of stream degradation and in building a sound stream conditions monitoring program for Yangtze River Delta.","tags":["Environmental variable","Qiantang River","Spatial factor","Stream community"],"title":"Different roles of environmental variables and spatial factors in structuring stream benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate in Yangtze River Delta, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karl Cottenie","Marianne Staempli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451624400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451624400,"objectID":"6e518e68ade4f12ad94e1660ab7cc5bb","permalink":"/publication/cottenie-2016-tli/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cottenie-2016-tli/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Concept mapping as means to critical thinking textbar Teaching and Learning Innovations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor T.

In addition, morphological identification may overlook species, obscuring patterns of competitive exclusion. To address these limitations, we showcase a molecular (DNA barcoding) approach to species-unit delineation and sample stream insect communities at small spatial scales where environmental filtering and dispersal limitations are minimised. Rocks from riffles were sampled for stream insects, in particular caddisfly (Trichoptera), beetle (Coleoptera) and blackfly (Simuliidae) larvae from filterer and grazer guilds at White Clay Creek, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. (20 June, 2013). Additive partitioning of species diversity was used to establish at which spatial scale(s) variation in the distribution of species occurs; this informed us of the spatial scale at which to conduct checkerboard analyses, which tested for signatures of species segregations (e.g. competitive exclusion). Only a small portion of the total species diversity occurred at the smallest spatial level (mean = 30% on individual rocks). Distributional variation in species was greatest at the kilometre scale (where beta-diversity was 37% and 41% for filterers and grazers respectively). At the scale of White Clay Creek sampled (c. 3 km extent), species of filterers showed a strong tendency to segregate on individual rocks, while grazers showed random structure approaching aggregation. This study demonstrates a potential approach to assessing the role of competition in structuring communities using observational data and highlights the importance of accurate species units for analysis (e.g. DNA barcoding). Using a combination of analyses, we were able to link patterns of segregation to competitive interactions among stream insect species in a filterer guild, while determining these interactions were not important in a grazer guild.","tags":["community structure","competition","molecular operational taxonomic units","spatial scale","stream insects"],"title":"Detecting signatures of competition from observational data: a combined approach using DNA barcoding, diversity partitioning and checkerboards at small spatial scales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Helmers","Alexis Platek","Melissa Ponte","Natalie Secen","Karl Cottenie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451624400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451624400,"objectID":"bb32425ba5e22194cd7ff85ad5579c88","permalink":"/publication/helmers-20161/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/helmers-20161/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on plant species richness in the freshwater lakes of Algonquin Provincial Park","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shubha N.

Are successional shifts from evergreen to deciduous understorey vegetation more likely to occur with greater depth of burn? Does a shift in understorey vegetation community towards more deciduous species influence carbon accumulation in vegetation biomass? Location Northern boreal forest, interior Alaska. Methods We sampled 32 stands in interior Alaska that burned in 2003 and 2004 in which depth of burn had been recorded soon after fire. In 2014 we characterized tree density, understorey vegetation composition, above- and below-ground vegetation carbon pools, and a suite of environmental variables. We used ANOVA and multivariate redundancy analysis models to analyse the dominant controls on vegetation composition and carbon pools. Results Fire severity was a strong control on post-fire tree and non-vascular species composition. Ten years post-fire, sites that experienced deeper burning of organic layers had a higher abundance of deciduous tree species, fire-adapted mosses, forbs and graminoids, and lower abundances of evergreen shrubs and Sphagnum mosses. Environmental variables (elevation, soil bulk density and mineral soil pH, moisture and temperature) served as important controls on tree and vascular understorey species composition. We found no evidence that carbon pools associated with recovering vegetation biomass were influenced by landscape position, fire severity or environmental variables. Conclusions Both fire frequency and depth of burn are projected to increase with a warmer climate in interior Alaska. These shifts in fire regime are expected to favour the regeneration of deciduous species over conifers, which have the potential to regulate successional pathways and large-scale trends in albedo, which both ultimately could influence ecosystem–climate feedbacks and dampen future fire cycles. Our results show that understorey species composition is controlled by fire severity, suggesting that more severe burning causes a decline in the self-replacement of conifer communities across a range of hydrologic settings. Overall, our results suggest a loss of resilience in black spruce forests in the face of a changing fire regime. However, we found no evidence that fire severity influences vegetation carbon pools 10 yrs post-fire, suggesting that there is less landscape variation in biomass carbon pools than in vegetation composition and succession during early post-fire succession.","tags":["Black spruce","Boreal forest","Deciduous","Depth of burn","Fire severity","Steady state","Successional trajectory","Understorey species composition","Vegetation carbon pools"],"title":"Variation in plant community composition and vegetation carbon pools a decade following a severe fire season in interior Alaska","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Piasecka","Roy Bernstein","Frans Ollevier","Filip Meersman","Caroline Souffreau","Roil M.

We first assessed how well variability in beta diversity of stream insect metacommunities is predicted by insect group, latitude, spatial extent, altitudinal range, and dataset properties across multiple drainage basins throughout the world. Second, we assessed the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in driving variation in assemblage composition within each drainage basin. Our analyses were based on a dataset of 95 stream insect metacommunities from 31 drainage basins distributed around the world. We used dissimilarity-based indices to quantify beta diversity for each metacommunity and, subsequently, regressed beta diversity on insect group, latitude, spatial extent, altitudinal range, and dataset properties (e.g., number of sites and percentage of presences). Within each metacommunity, we used a combination of spatial eigenfunction analyses and partial redundancy analysis to partition variation in assemblage structure into environmental, shared, spatial, and unexplained fractions. We found that dataset properties were more important predictors of beta diversity than ecological and geographical factors across multiple drainage basins. In the within-basin analyses, environmental and spatial variables were generally poor predictors of variation in assemblage composition. Our results revealed deviation from general biodiversity patterns because beta diversity did not show the expected decreasing trend with latitude. Our results also call for reconsideration of just how predictable stream assemblages are along ecological gradients, with implications for environmental assessment and conservation decisions. Our findings may also be applicable to other dynamic systems where predictability is low.","tags":["Altitude range","comparative analysis","environmental filtering","insects","latitude","spatial extent","variance partitioning"],"title":"A comparative analysis reveals weak relationships between ecological factors and beta diversity of stream insect metacommunities at two spatial levels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Linquist","Karl Cottenie","Tyler A.

Here, we critically evaluate the prospects of ecological neutral theory (ENT), a popular model in ecology, as it applies at the genomic level. This assessment requires an overview of the controversy surrounding neutral models in community ecology. In particular, we discuss the limitations of using ENT both as an explanation of community dynamics and as a null hypothesis. We then analyse a case study in which ENT has been applied to genomic data. Our central finding is that genetic elements do not conform to the requirements of ENT once its assumptions and limitations are made explicit. We further compare this genome-level application of ENT to two other, more familiar approaches in genomics that rely on neutral mechanisms: Kimura's molecular neutral theory and Lynch's mutational-hazard model. Interestingly, this comparison reveals that there are two distinct concepts of neutrality associated with these models, which we dub ‘fitness neutrality’ and ‘competitive neutrality’. This distinction helps to clarify the various roles for neutral models in genomics, for example in explaining the evolution of genome size.","tags":["ecological neutral theory","genome ecology","molecular ecology","molecular neutral theory","mutation hazard model","transposon ecology"],"title":"Applying ecological models to communities of genetic elements: the case of neutral theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Astrid N.

Many unionid mussels, which have larvae that are obligate parasites (usually on fish), are endangered and the conservation and management of these mussels depend on knowledge of the main drivers of their distribution. Metacommunity theory predicts that limited dispersal should weaken the association of community composition with environmental factors. We tested this prediction by comparing the strength of association with environmental factors of (i) mussels with different dispersal abilities based on mobility of known host fish and (ii) mussels with different host infection strategies targeting fish with different mobility. Mussels with more mobile host fish showed a significantly stronger association with host fish presence and catchment (as a proximate measure for large-scale differences in environmental conditions or as a spatial component) compared to mussels with less mobile host fish. Our results thus indicate that mussel distribution is more closely linked to host fish for high-dispersal mussels, which suggests the potential for species sorting. Mussel species with weak dispersal capabilities show the opposite pattern and are therefore less able to colonise all suitable sites (species sorting with limited dispersal). Thus, the absence of mussels does not necessarily indicate unsuitable environmental conditions, but can also be caused by dispersal limitation. The impact of different host infection strategies was less clear, and differences in responses could be driven by differences in host fish or even habitat specialisation in addition to potential differences in dispersal abilities. A better knowledge of the dispersal via host fish of unionid mussels and their host infection strategies will be crucial to understanding their metacommunity dynamics, a necessary precursor for effective conservation practices.","tags":["dispersal limitation","fish movement","generalist","host fish","life history trade-offs"],"title":"Dispersal abilities of riverine freshwater mussels influence metacommunity structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thiago Gonçalves-Souza","Gustavo Q.

Both are spatial in nature but their spatial scales do not necessarily match.

This discrimination is a necessary prerequisite for improved understanding of ecological phenomena across scales. Here we provide a case study to illustrate some spatial scale-dependent concepts in recent metacommunity studies and identify potential pitfalls. We presented here the diversity patterns of Neotropical lepidopterans and spiders viewed both from metacommunity and biogeographical perspectives. Specifically, we investigated how the relative importance of niche- and dispersal-based processes for community assembly change at two spatial scales: metacommunity scale, i.e. within a locality, and biogeographical scale, i.e. among localities widely scattered along a macroclimatic gradient. As expected, niche-based processes dominated the community assembly at metacommunity scale, while dispersal-based processes played a major role at biogeographical scale for both taxonomical groups. However, we also observed small but significant spatial effects at metacommunity scale and environmental effects at biogeographical scale. We also observed differences in diversity patterns between the two taxonomical groups corresponding to differences in their dispersal modes. Our results thus support the idea of continuity of processes interactively shaping diversity patterns across scales and emphasize the necessity of integration of metacommunity and biogeographical perspectives.","tags":["Arthropoda","Biogeography","Ecological niches","Leaves","Phylogeography","Plant morphology","Plants","Spiders"],"title":"Metacommunity versus Biogeography: A Case Study of Two Groups of Neotropical Vegetation-Dwelling Arthropods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Astrid N.

Neutral loci identified three subgroups: an Atlantic group, a Baltic Sea group and one on the Irish Shelf. The inclusion of loci putatively under selection suggested an additional break in the North Sea, subdividing southern from northern Atlantic individuals. Environmental and spatial seascape variables correlated marginally with neutral genetic variation, but explained significant proportions (respectively, 8.7% and 10.3%) of adaptive genetic variation. Environmental variables associated with outlier allele frequencies included salinity, temperature, bottom shear stress, dissolved oxygen concentration and depth of the pycnocline. Furthermore, levels of explained adaptive genetic variation differed markedly between basins (3% vs. 12% in the North and Baltic Sea, respectively). We suggest that stable environmental selection pressure contributes to relatively strong local adaptation in the Baltic Sea.

Specifically, each chromosome within the Bos taurus genome was treated as a “linear transect”, and a multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to identify large-scale spatial patterns in TE communities associated with 10 TE families. The position of each TE community on the chromosome accounted for ∼50% of the variation along the chromosome “transect”. Multivariate analysis further revealed an effect of gene density on TE communities that is influenced by several other factors in the (genomic) environment, including chromosome length and TE density.

Jeremy Fox (I know, he just keeps putting ideas in my head) comparesblogging basically to conference meetings. While I agree with the usefulness of this analogy, I think blogging goes deeper than that. Isn\u0026rsquo;t our ancient publication system a prototype of blogging, with references serving the double role of url links and comments/replys? Our old system is surely slower, but both systems even use the same philosophy to measure \u0026ldquo;importance\u0026rdquo;: pageranks for blogging and #references/citation index for papers (and more sophisticated methods such asthis paper, mentioned in a different context here).\nJeremy Fox and commenters to the Fletcher Halliday\u0026rsquo;s post also point out that the biggest difference between blogging and publications is the peer-review system. But this is \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; a difference in quality control, and not in intent. And this quality control system works reasonably well, I think. While I recently mentioned to some glowing reviews, I will now balance the scales with a recent anonymous review of a manuscript we submitted:\n\u0026ldquo;Beside these major problems, this MS suffers from a weak editing effort as suggested by the numerous errors found (e.g., several errors in the literature cited in text and the reference list, poor quality of figures without any explicit legends, redundancy in the method, result and discussion sections).

We were unable to implement a completely balanced design due to sample processing demands, which, for the sake of consistency, meant that all of the samples had to be counted within a short time frame.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;Because we were interested in synchrony in a metacommunity, we (i.e., Shubha) had to count densities of 3 species within all 4 communities of each metacommunity, or approximately 96 x 3 in total. All this in a limited time, and the individuals had to be put back to the original community to not affect population dynamics. This meant that we only had 2 replicated metacommunities (the experimental unit) for the 2 species treatment, and for all other treatments only 1 metacommunity.\nWe thus had to be really careful in how we worded the Figure 2 caption (see above, last line), since we could in principle only compute a measure of spread (e.g., standard error or deviation) for the 2 species points. However, that was also based on only 2 replicates. We thus decided not to add these, because it would be even more confusing to have some points with and some without some measure of variation indicated in the figure.\nThis could, of course, raise the question whether not adding this information to the main figure of our article is not only removing potential confusion, but also removes visual clues to readers about the limitations of our study, i.e., the lack of replication for most of the treatments.\nI do believe we are only guilty of the first (removing confusion), since to test the interaction term EF x S, we only had 3 degrees of freedom (see Table 1). Despite this low power, we fought hard to get these results in, because when looking at the Figure 2, I think nobody would question that the lines that connect EF treatments with the same species richness are basically parallel to each other, and thus provides visual confirmation of the non-significant interaction term associated with the low degrees of freedom due to lack of full-factorial design.\nThis is thus one of my publications that for a large part hinge on the visual interpretation of the results (Figure 2, above) and the statistics (and all the other figures and tables) only had a confirmational role. I was really glad I had read Analysis of messy data, to convince the reviewers.\n","date":1358750460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1358750460,"objectID":"73e5c4a9a8ceedd45d614d1e387c805f","permalink":"/post/synchrony-in-metacommunities/","publishdate":"2013-01-21T06:41:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/synchrony-in-metacommunities/","section":"post","summary":"A new year, a new publication, this time with Shubha and Jurek: \u0026ldquo;Population synchrony decreases with richness and increases with environmental ﬂuctuations in an experimental metacommunity\u0026rdquo; in Oecologia.

This will make it easier for others to point out my logical mistakes, and thus to correct my thinking, and my understanding of ecology. Original argument by Dr. Foxcorrelation does not equal causatione.g. abundance in species over timedata2 species, abundances not correlatedspecies abundances correlated with weathernaive conclusionno density dependenceweather importantDr. Fox’s conclusion: this is wrongcorrelation is not prediction of density dependence (example from economics)implicationzombie idea: “misinterpreting correlations, and lack of correlations, among variables as evidence for or against causality when those variables are affected by density-dependent feedbacks”in community ecology: “Given that there’s intra- and interspecific density dependence within sites, I doubt that you can reliably infer the causes of metacommunity structure just by looking for statistical associations between environmental and geographic variables, and species abundances.”My initial responseafter reading that last quote, I thought that Dr. Fox made this conclusion:so “correlations, partial correlations, variance partitioning, multiple regression, structural equation modeling, or related statistical methods” become useless in ecology, since this is probably a density-dependent dynamical systembecause of this zombie idea dismissing general statistical techniques as tools to “infer how causality works in a density-dependent dynamical system” seems a bridge too far. I think that this could become a zombie idea in itself if lots of ecologists would follow this advice.but I doubt that this is the intent of the blog post. The key word being “reliably”; he probably added this for people like myself to the sentence. Without it, it would seem that Dr. Fox is negating the scientific method; with this word, you can talk about observational versus experimental approaches, weak and strong tests of certain hypotheses etc.I thus read the whole blog post again in more detail, followed by coming up with a second response.My second responseI do think that Dr. Fox pulls a sleight of hand:Dr. Fox’s conclusion and example only deals with pointing out that correlation is not a good prediction for density dependencebut the data do provide evidence for the hypothesis that weather influences population abundances through food availability etc.so my conclusion for the data from Dr. Fox outlined abovethere is evidence that weather is importantnot a good test for whether density dependence is important or not, so not possible to make any conclusion on this aspectimplications of this for variation decomposition as a method to detect metacommunity processesany statistical method is only as good as the prediction and associated hypothesis it is testingnot good to test for density dependencecould be for testing e.g. effects of environment on species abundancesstatistical methods have their limitations (see indeed Gilbert and Bennett 2010, as pointed out by Dr. Fox)thus observational data should be accompanied by experimental studiessee e.g. my PhD work (from a long time ago, observational study\u0026nbsp;using variation decomposition, and experimental study)my 2005 publication\u0026nbsp;should thus only be seen as a starting pointthere is lots of evidence for species sorting in response to environmental condition in general in these potentially dynamic systems (in 73% of the data sets)it is difficult, but not impossible, to include for instance competition or density dependence or time or evolution into these analyses.we should explore more interesting or detailed predictions, and some of these could use variation decomposition (e.g. generalist versus specialist species\u0026nbsp;or body size)The real problem would be that the zombie idea of testing density dependence with correlation could somehow make the correlations between species abundances and weather invalid.I maybe missed this explanation in the blog post, but I could not find how density dependence could make not significant external drivers significant (but if I am wrong, let me know)maybe this is addressed in Ziebarth et al. 2010, and is implicitly suggested by Dr. Fox?My conclusionsDr. Fox convincingly illustrates that correlation is not a good prediction for the hypothesis of density dependence, and there exist better predictions and tests.My 2005 article is flawed, but I do not think that this zombie idea of density dependence is the most important one (we are working on a follow article, though).Writing blog posts are fun, especially if you have a skilled writer as Dr. Fox giving you starting points.

However, we reanalyzed published studies with a new unbiased method and found no prevalence of linear relationships and more than 40% of misclassifications, including textbook examples. We thus conclude that the prevailing argument in favor of associating a valid ecological interpretation to local–regional species richness plots, its ubiquity, is not sustained, and that ecologists could use for instance metacommunity theory to make inference on the strength of local and regional processes. Identifying the relative importance of regional and local processes to local species diversity is a central issue to many questions in basic and applied ecology. One widely-used method is to plot local species richness against its regional richness to infer whether regional or local processes determine local diversity. However, this method increases the tendency to find regional prevalence as suggested by a recent simulation. We reanalyzed studies in the literature with an unbiased method and found no prevalence of either regional or local processes. In addition, almost 40% of the studies and 50% of the ecology textbook examples using the traditional method were misclassified. Our findings reinforce the need of alternative, novel tools identified by for instance metacommunity theory to go beyond the studies of local–regional relationships in the ecological literature that focus on the interdependence of regional and local processes.","tags":null,"title":"A critical analysis of the ubiquity of linear local–regional richness relationships","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Linquist","Brent Saylor","Karl Cottenie","Tyler A.

Noting a similarity to the assortment of organisms among ecosystems, some researchers have called for an ecological approach to the study of transposon dynamics. However, there are several ways to adopt such an approach, and it is sometimes unclear what an ecological perspective will add to the existing co-evolutionary framework for explaining transposon-host interactions. This review aims to clarify the conceptual foundations of transposon ecology in order to evaluate its explanatory prospects. We begin by identifying three unanswered questions regarding the abundance and distribution of TEs that potentially call for an ecological explanation. We then offer an operational distinction between evolutionary and ecological approaches to these questions. By determining the amount of variance in transposon abundance and distribution that is explained by ecological and evolutionary factors, respectively, it is possible empirically to assess the prospects for each of these explanatory frameworks. To illustrate how this methodology applies to a concrete example, we analyzed whole-genome data for one set of distantly related mammals and another more closely related group of arthropods. Our expectation was that ecological factors are most informative for explaining differences among individual TE lineages, rather than TE families, and for explaining their distribution among closely related as opposed to distantly related host genomes. We found that, in these data sets, ecological factors do in fact explain most of the variation in TE abundance and distribution among TE lineages across less distantly related host organisms. Evolutionary factors were not significant at these levels. However, the explanatory roles of evolution and ecology become inverted at the level of TE families or among more distantly related genomes. Not only does this example demonstrate the utility of our distinction between ecological and evolutionary perspectives, it further suggests an appropriate explanatory domain for the burgeoning discipline of transposon ecology. The fact that ecological processes appear to be impacting TE lineages over relatively short time scales further raises the possibility that transposons might serve as useful model systems for testing more general hypotheses in ecology.","tags":["evolution","ecology","multivariate analysis","philosophy of science","transposable elements"],"title":"Distinguishing ecological from evolutionary approaches to transposable elements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Astrid N.

Therefore, we tested the prediction that (1) the distribution of host fishes explains a significant amount of variation in mussel community composition. In addition, because mussel distribution also depends on spatial processes and environmental variables, we predicted that (2) the distribution and community composition of mussels in Ontario varies across eight contiguous watersheds, flowing into three different basins of the Great Lakes (Huron, St. Clair and Erie); and (3) environmental variables also explain part of the mussel distribution. Location Watersheds in south-western Ontario, North America, Great Lakes Region. Methods Existing data on the distribution of mussels and fishes, and environmental and spatial information were compiled. Variation partitioning with redundancy analysis was used to examine what proportion of the variation in mussels' community composition was explained by watershed (as a spatial component), environmental differences and host fish presence. Redundancy analysis for mussel abundances was used to illustrate the similarities in the distributions of mussels and fishes, and the association of differences in community composition of mussels among watersheds with certain mussel species and environmental variables. Results Host fish presence explained 44%, watershed identity 28% and environmental factors 23% of the variation in mussel species composition. However, much of the explained variation was shared among these components, and all three components together explained 55% of the total variation in species composition. Even after statistically eliminating the other explanatory variables, host fish distribution was the most important group of predictor variables, although we used a subset of relevant environmental variables because of the scale of the study.

Synchrony may be an important variable in multispecies systems, but its nature and implications have not been explicitly examined. Because the number of locally coexisting species (richness) affects the population variability of community members, we manipulated richness under different regimes of environmental fluctuation (EF). We predicted that the temporal synchrony of populations in a species should decline with increasing richness of the metacommunity they live in. Additionally, we predicted that specialist species that are sensitive to a specific environmental factor would show higher synchronization when EF increases. We thus created experimental communities with varied richness, EF, and species specialization to examine the synchronizing effects of these factors on three aquatic invertebrate species. We created four levels of richness and three levels of EF by manipulating the salinity of the culture media. Monocultures exhibited higher population synchrony than metacommunities of 2–4 species. Furthermore, we found that species responded differently to EF treatments: high EF enhanced population synchrony for the specialist and intermediate species, but not for the generalist species. Our findings emphasize that the magnitude of EF and species richness both contribute to determine population synchrony, and importantly, our results suggest that biotic diversity may actually stabilize metacommunities by disrupting synchrony.","tags":["Cross-correlation function","Environmental fluctuations","Habitat specialization gradient","Metacommunity","Population synchrony","Species richness"],"title":"Population synchrony decreases with richness and increases with environmental fluctuations in an experimental metacommunity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rachel M.

Testing how deterministic and stochastic processes combine to regulate diversity, however, has been limited by the spatial complexity of these interactions. Here, we demonstrate how spatial variability in small-mammal predation on plants, mostly by granivory, results in fine-scale switching between deterministically and stochastically regulated plant community assembly in an otherwise environmentally homogeneous tallgrass prairie. We initiated assembly with the uniform application of a 24-species mixture of prairie grasses and forbs, thereby setting the maximum level of diversity (γ-diversity). In field edges with higher densities of small mammals, traits reducing seed palatability deterministically produced homogeneous subsets of less palatable plant species within the first few months after planting (low α and β diversity). As small-mammal densities decreased in more open areas, assembly unfolded stochastically on the basis of which planted species happened to land at a given location (high α and β diversity). We used randomization models to validate that this higher β diversity was explained by true differences in community structure among plots rather than by the hidden effects of increasing α diversity. The net effect at the site level was a spatially structured array of prairie species, including a positive relationship between diversity and environmental suitability relating to reduced predator intensity.","tags":null,"title":"Spatial Variability in Plant Predation Determines the Strength of Stochastic Community Assembly","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Talk about climate change, and be sure that your analyses are rock solid, because you will get some serious backlash.

I would refrain from using \u0026ldquo;local vs. regional\u0026rdquo; here, because \u0026ldquo;regional\u0026rdquo; also has the connotation of \u0026ldquo;at a larger scale\u0026rdquo;, while the action of these \u0026ldquo;regional\u0026rdquo; process are sometimes at the within-site scale. For instance, climatic features such as rain or\u0026nbsp;temperature\u0026nbsp;are regional in nature, but each organism experiences this within a site. So it is a regional process at a within-site scale, in that case (another quagmire of confusing terminology).What is the nature of the species differences: are they niche-based (or under selection sensy Vellend 2010) versus neutral (or probabilistic equivalence of species sensu Rosindell et al.)?What is the stochastic nature of these ecological processes: Do they result in a deterministic or stochastic outcome?How do you detect the signature of these ecological processes? Through randomization procedures, or explained variation, or noise, or \u0026hellip;Using this scheme, I think you could uniquely identify several terms and patterns in the literature, and solve some of the inconsistencies noted above:\ndrift is a specific type of end product of within-site,\u0026nbsp;neutral, and\u0026nbsp;stochastic, species interactionsdispersal can be\u0026nbsp;neutral: all species similar in dispersal characteristics\u0026nbsp;or niche-based: see the classic patch dynamic framework inLeibold et al. 2004or stochastic: see limiting dispersal sensu Winegardner et al. 2012(see e.g.Matias et al. in press) , but with some deterministic patterns (see distance decay or isolation by distance in neutral metacommunities, Jeremy Fox\u0026rsquo;s 2nd zombie idea mentioned above).or deterministic: see efficient or high dispersal sensu Winegardner et al. 2012neutral species interactions canlead to dominance of one species over long time periods, and thus look deterministicbe deterministic (see Jeremy Fox\u0026rsquo;s examples in his first zombie idea)selection can be stochastic (see also Jeremy Fox\u0026rsquo;s example in his first zombie idea)\nCaution\nIt would be easy to fall in the trap outlined by Jeremy Fox, and treat these questions as \u0026ldquo;ends of a linear continuum\u0026rdquo;. I do think they are ends of a continuum, but this does not have to linear (which is what I think the main danger is that Jeremy Fox wanted to point out).I reserve the right to change my mind on this above classification, based on what I hope to be lots of discussion and exchange of ideas.\n","date":1354081560,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354081560,"objectID":"4a92e6b9d977b51238852c8b412e0af9","permalink":"/post/why-consistent-terminology-is-important/","publishdate":"2012-11-28T05:46:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/why-consistent-terminology-is-important/","section":"post","summary":"Some time ago, I received this email from a grad student:\u0026ldquo;Do you know the blog zombies ideas in ecology??

Consequently, many studies have analyzed the performance of certain groups as indicator taxa. However, in addition to knowing whether certain groups can adequately represent the biodiversity as a whole, we must also know whether they show similar responses to the main structuring processes affecting biodiversity. Here we present an application of the metacommunity framework for evaluating the effectiveness of biodiversity indicators. Although the metacommunity framework has contributed to a better understanding of biodiversity patterns, there is still limited discussion about its implications for conservation and biomonitoring. We evaluated the effectiveness of indicator taxa in representing spatial variation in macroinvertebrate community composition in Atlantic Forest streams, and the processes that drive this variation. We focused on analyzing whether some groups conform to environmental processes and other groups are more influenced by spatial processes, and on how this can help in deciding which indicator group or groups should be used. We showed that a relatively small subset of taxa from the metacommunity would represent 80% of the variation in community composition shown by the entire metacommunity. Moreover, this subset does not have to be composed of predetermined taxonomic groups, but rather can be defined based on random subsets. We also found that some random subsets composed of a small number of genera performed better in responding to major environmental gradients. There were also random subsets that seemed to be affected by spatial processes, which could indicate important historical processes. We were able to integrate in the same theoretical and practical framework, the selection of biodiversity surrogates, indicators of environmental conditions, and more importantly, an explicit integration of environmental and spatial processes into the selection approach.","tags":["Biodiversity","Community ecology","Community structure","Conservation science","Ecological niches","Eigenvectors","Forests","Taxonomy"],"title":"A Metacommunity Framework for Enhancing the Effectiveness of Biological Monitoring Strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our first publication from the amazing spanish pond system set-up by Andy Green and his group, but especially with the hard work of Dagmar Frisch, who has the patience of a saint to keep collaborating with me: \u0026ldquo;Strong Spatial Influence on Colonization Rates in a Pioneer Zooplankton Metacommunity\u0026rdquo; in Plos One.\nEach published article is unique in its calvary to publication.

Let the hypothesis be that average global temperature has increased over the past century by at least two degrees.\u0026nbsp; Let the prediction that one derives from this hypothesis be that the average space between tree rings will have increased over the past 100 years in trees that are at least 130 years old. Now, suppose that we go out and core some 130 year old trees to test this prediction. Lo and behold, we find that there is no change in the average distance between tree rings in our sample: the observation “falsifies” the hypothesis. Should we reject the hypothesis on these grounds? Of course not! \u0026nbsp;Instead, we identify a questionable auxiliary assumption that was implicitly used to derive the prediction. Let the auxiliary (background) assumption be that, in our sample, soil quality did not change over the past century. \u0026nbsp;If soil quality did change, then we would not necessarily expect tree ring distances to increase. This leads us to conduct a new experiment on soil quality in our original sample of trees. And so the process goes. \u0026nbsp; “But that’s just the HD method!” you might claim. No, it is not.\u0026nbsp; If you are inclined to say this, you are like the chef who thinks that Chef Popper is describing your recipe. The reason that the process I just described is not the HD method (under any guise) is because it is not a\u0026nbsp;method. Let me explain why.Any hypothesis depends on a huge number of auxiliary hypotheses in order to derive a prediction. Importantly, by “derive” I mean\u0026nbsp; deduce according to logical rules. This is important because we are trying to come up with a method (recipe) that anyone (monkey?) could follow.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; To derive, logically, a prediction from a hypothesis, thousands of other (background) assumptions must be in place.\u0026nbsp; For instance, take the derivation: if average temp has increased by 2 degrees, then there should be an increase in the distance between tree rings in the sample population. To do this, one must \u0026nbsp;also assume that: \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; * The sample had roughly stable nutrients for the last century.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; * The sample was exposed to stable atmospheric gasses.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; * The earth did not undergo a major shift in rotation around the sun.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; * Climate change deniers did not tamper with the evidence.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; etc. Now, some of these auxiliary assumptions strike us as ludicrous (or at least highly unlikely). But that is part of the point that I am trying to illustrate. The reason that some of these auxiliary assumptions strike you as silly is because you know better – you have what I referred to as discipline specific knowledge in my previous post. Remember that the name of the game is to come up with a method, the analog of a recipe, that allows one to do good science (or distinguish good from bad science). I am claiming here that in order to do good science, one must know which auxiliary assumptions are reasonable to question in the face of evidence that conflicts with one’s predictions. \u0026nbsp;The person who tests whether the earth underwent a major shift in rotation, for example, is not doing good science.Since the list of auxiliary hypotheses is indefinitely long, one cannot simply test them all. Tom argues that Popper's contribution (the philosopher, not the chef) was to identify falsifiability as the mark of science. But that can't be right, because any hypothesis can be rendered unfalsifiable with the right sort of tweaking to auxiliary assumptions. One can always cling to a cherished hypothesis in the face of conflicting evidence by raising questions about the auxiliary hypotheses instead. That is why falsifiability is not an adequate criterion for distinguishing good from bad science.\u0026nbsp;In practice, of course, we do not let people get away with indefinite amounts of tweaking to background hypotheses. Sometimes a scientist will hold onto a hypothesis in the face of conflicting evidence; other times she will reject it. The important point is that nothing about the HD method enables one to make these judgments.\u0026nbsp; How one makes these judgments depends on the information available about the system in question, the range and nature of the assumptions informing one's study, the prevailing theories, etc. That is what I meant when I said that if you want to know how a science works, look at how it deviates from \u0026nbsp;the HD method. In other words, to understand a science, look at which hypotheses are rejected and which are retained in the face of conflicting evidence. In my earlier post I called this as “discipline specific” knowledge. Karl seems to have mistaken me for saying that one has to be initiated into a discipline in some formal sense in order to acquire discipline specific knowledge.\u0026nbsp; He imagines trying to test some sociological hypothesis (I think it was a hypothesis about the tendency for ecologists, unlike most other scientists, \u0026nbsp;to be wedded to the HD model). Nothing is preventing him from trying. Nothing is preventing me from trying to bake a cake with Chef Popper’s instructions. \u0026nbsp;Let me know how that works out for you though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The important point is this. To have a method is to have a recipe.\u0026nbsp; Chef Popper’s instructions were not a real recipe because they do not provide a set of step by step instructions for baking a great cake.\u0026nbsp; Similarly, Philosopher Popper did not provide a scientific method. He also did not provide a set of instructions that are adequate for doing science well. \u0026nbsp;One of the reasons why Philosopher Popper’s instructions are inadequate is because they do not tell you which background assumptions are reasonable to question when predictions are not borne out. There is NO discipline-general method for making these decisions. I should add that the only original bit of philosophy here is the story. Philosophers of science have recognized these limitations in the HD \"method\" for decades. I reckon that we have just done a poor job of explaining its limitations to other disciplines. I fear that I might not be doing much better.

If the target areas have all the species you want to conserve, but lack essential components that would ensure their actual persistence through time, representativeness means nothing.\u0026nbsp;Wiersma and Nudds addressed this in their article by focussing on one important component of target areas, minimum reserve area:\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026nbsp;use candidate protected areas that meet an empirically-derived estimate for a\u0026nbsp;minimum reserve area (MRA) above which no mammal extinctions have been\u0026nbsp;detected from existing protected areas since widespread European settlement,\u0026nbsp;even in parks that have become insularized from the surrounding habitat\u0026nbsp;matrix (Gurd et al. 2001).\u0026rdquo;Despite the obvious logic of this argument, not all conservation planning uses it. In the summer of 2011, Pompa and co-authorspublished an article on developing target areas for conserving marine mammals.\nConservation targets covering (A) 10%, (B) 15%, (C) 20%, and (D) 25% of the marine mammal distributions using the Marxan optimization algorithm to optimize the number of grid cells and its geographic location.Yolanda and Tom recently wrote a lettre pointing out the lack of including this notion of persistence in the set-up of the Pompa et al. analysis:\n\u0026ldquo;Our argument previously (3) has been that percentage targets do not allow for any assessment of whether species will persist in areas set aside for conservation, and this critique continues to hold for the analysis by Pompa et al.

The somehow summarize the single point of the criticism into four separate points:\n\u0026ldquo;Wiersma and Nudds (1) make four main points: (i) the area to be covered by the key conservation sites proposed is a negligible percentage of the ocean; (ii) they doubt the representativeness of our biodiversity patterns; (iii) they question the persistence of the species; and (iv) they claim we do not acknowledge the dynamic nature of ecological systems.\u0026rdquo;Of the 4 main points identified by Pompa et al. in their reply, (i) and (ii) were side points on the limitations of only including representativeness, and they implicit agree that they did not address point (iv). And it is not that Wiersma and Nudds questioned the persistence (iii) per se of the species, Wiersma and Nudds pointed out, rightly, \u0026nbsp;that this necessary and important condition was not part of the original Pompa et al. conservation strategy.\nInstead of acknowledging this directly, they use the scientist cop out, which is so easy to make, but also so unsatisfactory and weak:\n\u0026ldquo;Despite constraints, our approach still best available.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":1328877900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1328877900,"objectID":"888e4c4df66a128924aae4a8c8ed0fd9","permalink":"/post/scientific-debate.../","publishdate":"2012-02-10T12:45:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/scientific-debate.../","section":"post","summary":"\u0026hellip; rests on actually reading and understanding each other\u0026rsquo;s words.\nThis is a difficult exercise, and not only for students.

However, although power laws have been reported in areas ranging from finance and molecular biology to geophysics and the Internet, the data are typically insufficient and the mechanistic insights are almost always too limited for the identification of power-law behavior to be scientifically useful (see the figure). Indeed, even most statistically “successful” calculations of power laws offer little more than anecdotal value.\u0026rdquo;One argument that they use is that power laws are a statistical feature (or artifact, depending on your point of view) of probabilistic theory:\n\u0026ldquo;Suppose that one generates a large number of independent random variables\u0026nbsp;xi\u0026nbsp;drawn from heavy-tailed distributions, which need not be power laws.

We get so many questions that start out with \u0026ldquo;Is this a good test?\u0026rdquo;, and we always have to get back to them with our standard reply \u0026ldquo;Context is everything\u0026rdquo;: this test means nothing to us without knowing the context. And now I can refer them to this article as a nice example of the fallacy of focusing on the stats in isolation of the rest.\nIn addition, the authors also provide a subtle argument against the seductive power of induction. Their concluding sentence reads:\n\u0026ldquo;The most productive use of power laws in the real world will therefore, we believe, come from recognizing their ubiquity (and perhaps exploiting them to simplify or even motivate subsequent analysis) rather than from imbuing them with a vague and mistakenly mystical sense of universality.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":1328696400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1328696400,"objectID":"1692424f03b71e475342db63a052077a","permalink":"/post/context-is-everything/","publishdate":"2012-02-08T10:20:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/context-is-everything/","section":"post","summary":"An interesting paper in Science by Stumpf and Porter\u0026nbsp;takes a hard look at \u0026ldquo;general\u0026rdquo; power laws in science:\n\u0026ldquo;A striking feature that has attracted considerable attention is the apparent ubiquity of power-law relationships in empirical data.

It actually explores this tension between individual versus group learning. The outset of the paper is the experimental result that in networks of learners (i.e., collaborators), reducing the speed of information exchange between learners (or network efficiency) actually leads to higher performance of the network as a whole.\u0026nbsp;Or translated into the Cain framework: introverts can be introverts, do not have to adjust to group thinking, and can thus lead to higher performing networks (note: this is not necessarily the 40 years of research that Cain refers to).\u0026nbsp;The mechanism provided in the PNAS article puts this in more scientific terms:\n\u0026ldquo;[T]he explanation is that slowing down the rate at which individuals learn, either from the “organizational code” (3) or from each other (8, 11, 13), forces them to undertake more of their own exploration, which, in turn, reduces the likelihood that the collective will converge prematurely on a suboptimal solution.\u0026rdquo;The problem with this mechanism is that it is mainly based on computer simulations. The novelty of the article is that they tested it with real, human, players using a large sample size. And they found the opposite results:\nnetwork efficiency was positively correlated with performanceAverage points earned by players in the different networks over rounds (error bars are ±1 SE) in sessions where the peak is found. Graphs with high clustering and long path lengths are shown in dark gray; those with low clustering and low path lengths are shown in light gray.players copied less in more efficient networks(A) In contrast to theoretical expectations, less efficient networks displayed a higher tendency to copy; hence, they explored less than more efficient networks [numbers and colors (orange is shorter and green is longer) both indicate clustering coefficient]. (B) Probability of finding the peak is not reliably different between efficient and inefficient networks.These results indicate that in networks with efficient information exchange, individual behaviour (of for instance introverts) is valued, and this\u0026nbsp;individual\u0026nbsp;behaviour helps to increase the performance of the group. Or the apparent contradiction between collaboration and introverts is saved!\nThis blog post provides some real-world evidence for this. It is a book review of Steven Johnsons\u0026rsquo;s Where good ideas come from. John Batelle extracts\u0026nbsp;this nice figure (which of course appeals to myself as a scientist), illustrating that major ideas arise more frequently in a networked environment:\nJohnson\u0026rsquo;s chart of major ideas emerging during the 19th century, categorized by commercial and networked properties\nThe two sides of the collaboration coin are thus individuality and efficient information exchange.\nIt is not that simple, of course, but at least it provides a mechanism to for instance increase the efficiency of collaborations in a class room setting:\nit is important that everyone participatesit is important that everyone thinks about the issue by themselves, before sharing it with the groupit is important to listen to everyonethe flow of information between participants should be as efficient as possible\n\n","date":1328012340,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1328012340,"objectID":"a7ae1864f4488c226502a2adb91bf1ad","permalink":"/post/collaborative-learning-two-sides-of-a-coin/","publishdate":"2012-01-31T12:19:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/collaborative-learning-two-sides-of-a-coin/","section":"post","summary":"Collaboration is on my mind these days.

Most studies relate rarity to either niche differentiation among species or spatial processes. There is a parallel between these processes and the processes proposed to explain the structure of metacommunities. Based on a metacommunity perspective and on data on stream macroinvertebrates from different regions of Brazil, we answer two questions. 1) Are sets of common and rare species affected by similar niche and spatial processes? 2) How does the community composition of common and of rare species differ? The main hypothesis we test is that common species are mainly affected by environmental factors, whereas rare species are mostly influenced by dispersal limitation. We used variation partitioning to determine the proportion of variation explained by the environment and space in common and rare species matrices. Contrary to our expectations, evidence supported the idea that both common and rare species are affected mainly by environmental factors, even after controlling for the differing information content between common and rare species matrices. Moreover, the abundance of some common species is also a good predictor of variation in rare species matrices. Niche differences are unlikely to be the sole cause of patterns of rarity in these metacommunities. We suggest that sets of common and rare species react to similar major environmental gradients and that rare species also respond to processes that operate at a more fine-grained spatial scale, particularly biotic interactions. We extend the view that species sorting is the dominant process structuring metacommunities and argue that future studies focusing on rarity would benefit from a metacommunity perspective.","tags":null,"title":"Common and rare species respond to similar niche processes in macroinvertebrate metacommunities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keith M.

We hypothesized that lighting would improve trap success by increasing the attraction to, entrance into, or retention within portable sea lamprey traps. The responses of migratory sea lampreys to nocturnal lighting were complex and situation dependent. In the laboratory, where two traps were placed side by side, more sea lampreys were caught in the lit trap than in the unlit trap (80% versus 20%), largely because of increased attraction to the lit trap (75% of trap funnel entries by sea lampreys were in lit traps). In the field, where two traps were set 9 m apart and located against a barrier to upstream movement, there was no consistent difference in the numbers of sea lampreys caught in lit versus unlit traps. We provide two hypotheses for the variability in response to trap lighting between the laboratory and field, but overall the inconsistency of sea lamprey response to trap lighting leads us to conclude that the benefits of implementing trap lighting for sea lamprey control are limited. Lighting traps may be beneficial in situations where lighting is implemented in conjunction with other trap modifications that attract sea lampreys to within close proximity of traps or when traps are operated in stream locations that already encounter high volumes of sea lampreys.

It was thus with a lot of interest that I read this very provocative and well-written Oikos blog post, written by Jeremy Fox:\nhttp://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/zombie-ideas-in-ecology/\n\u0026nbsp;However, I was a bit confused by some of his arguments. Below, I provide some details about my confusion, and I hope that somebody will be able to resolve my confusion?\nBy the way, I will address Jeremy Fox as Jeremy, although we have never met in real life. I hope he doesn\u0026rsquo;t mind, and that our paths will cross at some point ;-)\nFirst zombie:\n\u0026ldquo;Disturbance reduces species’ densities, thereby weakening or eliminating competition and preventing the competitive exclusion that occurs in undisturbed environments. But too much disturbance kills off all but the most disturbance-tolerant or quickest-recovering species, hence intermediate levels of disturbance support the highest diversity.\u0026rdquo;The first sentence suggest to me that\n1) without disturbance, competitive exclusion leads to the dominance of one species, and\u0026nbsp;2) with limited disturbance, competitive exclusion is halted because of lower densities, and thus resources not being limiting.\u0026nbsp;The second sentence suggests to me that the mechanism for the low species richness at\n3) high disturbance is not about competitive exclusion anymore, but stress tolerance.\u0026nbsp;Jeremy argument that this is a zombie seems to only address option 2 (lower densities does not necessarily mean lower interaction strengths, and thus weakening competitive exclusion). I think that Jeremy would agree with 1) (competitive exclusion is such a basic concept) and, maybe implicitly, with 3).\u0026nbsp;He uses both theoretical (Chesson and Huntly 1997)\u0026nbsp;and an experimental (Voille et al. 2010)\u0026nbsp;evidence to back up his view of conclusion 2) of how\u0026nbsp;competition is an important structuring force at all levels of disturbance, and I agree with that.\nHowever, my interpretation of statement 3) (and IDH in general) is that this is not only about competition, but about competition in the presence of different stress tolerances between species. I always thought that the competition-tolerance trade-off \u0026nbsp;is precisely an example of what Chesson and Huntly mean when they write \u0026ldquo;Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely\u0026rdquo;. Isn\u0026rsquo;t the competition-tolerance trade-off exactly such a niche difference? And wouldn\u0026rsquo;t intermediate disturbance allow the coexistence of these two types of species, and thus higher species richness at intermediate disturbances relative to low and high disturbance situations? I am probably missing something, but I think that the Chesson and Huntly argument make this only a zombie if all species are ecologically similar (from their abstract: \u0026ldquo;Near-exclusive focus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they\u0026nbsp;reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of\u0026nbsp;even ecologically very similar species\u0026rdquo;), while the IDH argument explicitly deals with (two) groups of very different species.\nInterestingly, Voille et al. 2010 also provides an example of\u0026nbsp;how competition-stress tolerance trade offs (see fig. 1) can lead to an IDH-like pattern:\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;Before day 22, species extinction occurred mostly at the high end of\u0026nbsp;the disturbance gradient, resulting from the joint effects of competition and disturbance (discussed below). Between day 22 and\u0026nbsp;day 24, however, competitive exclusion occurred rather rapidly at\u0026nbsp;low disturbance levels, presumably because of strong competition\u0026nbsp;associated with high population densities. As a result, diversity\u0026nbsp;was temporarily high at intermediate disturbance levels on day 24.\u0026nbsp;On all other sampling days, however, species richness always decreased monotonically with disturbance (Fig. 2 A, B, D, and E).\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;While this quote illustrates both the short-term expression of IDH (only a couple of days compared to the strong competitive exclusion throughout the full duration of the experiment in this system, it does illustrate the importance of \u0026nbsp;trade-offs, and explicitly incorporating the temporal component in these IDH studies.\u0026nbsp;Incidentally, the nature of the disturbance was very drastic: it eliminated a fraction of the whole population every day throughout the experiment, resulting in possible coexistence at only the 2 lowest disturbance levels.\n\nSo I don\u0026rsquo;t see how these two lines of evidence refute this first zombie as a potential mechanism leading to an IDH-like pattern. What am I missing here?\nSecond zombie:\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026nbsp;Disturbances interrupt competitive exclusion by temporarily reducing all species to low density and weakening competition, thereby allowing all species to subsequently increase.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;Jeremy agrees that after disturbance slows exclusion: \u0026ldquo;I mean, you take a competition model which exhibits rapid competitive exclusion, you add disturbance, and you get much slower exclusion. Which means that disturbance slows exclusion, right? And if you look at the simulated time series, you see that all the competitors increase after each disturbance\u0026rdquo;. He then makes a switch I do not understand: he claims that while this is true, it is not the correct comparison to make, since disturbance changes not only time to reach exclusion, it also changes the long-term average mortality rate. However, from a community that experiences disturbance, I fail to see how it matters whether disturbances changes only the time to reach conclusion, versus time to reach conclusion AND long-term average mortality rate. From the community\u0026rsquo;s perspective, competitive exclusion is temporarily halted, and thus potentially increases diversity (and potentially an IDH pattern). I think the key point here is \u0026ldquo;temporarily\u0026rdquo;. I agree that after a longer time period the community will reach equilibrium with associated competitive exclusion, and thus \u0026ldquo;zero effect on the long-term outcome\u0026rdquo;. But why is it necessary to eliminate the temporal dynamics in this IDH context? Disturbance has several components (see Mackey and Currie 2001, Table 1), of which several are explicitly temporal: frequency, time passed since last disturbance, chronic vs. episodic. In these context, I fail to see why zombie 2 has no merit. What am I missing here?\n\nThird zombie:\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026nbsp;If, due to fluctuating environmental conditions, the identity of the dominant competitor changes on an intermediate timescale, no one species will ever have time to exclude the others and all will coexist. Overly-slow fluctuations will allow exclusion to take place before conditions change. Species will average across overly-fast fluctuations, and whichever species competes best on average under the full range of environmental conditions will exclude the others.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s explanation on why this is zombie, I am starting to note a theme. He explicitly eliminates the temporal component, and calls this \u0026ldquo;the right way to think about it\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; long-term average competitive outcomes \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; without worrying about the frequency with which the environment changes \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; it just takes a really long time \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; notice that we never said one word about the timescale \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;On the other hand, he does agree that \u0026ldquo;fluctuating conditions that temporarily favor one species over another do create an opportunity for that favored species to grow\u0026rdquo;. Again, he seems to make an implicit assumption that \u0026ldquo;temporarily\u0026rdquo; is not good enough to result in an IDH pattern, and he completely ignores the temporal aspects of IDH (see above) by focusing his arguments so strongly on the long-term dynamics.\u0026nbsp;\nIDH Zombies?\nAre these three zombies identified by Jeremy really zombies? It seems to me that his first zombie actually provides a mechanism for (potentially long-term) IDH patterns because of the competition-tolerance trade-offs associated with it, and that zombies 2 and 3 are only zombies when looking at long-term dynamics. However, this makes the important, and in my view overly restrictive assumption, that the temporal aspects of IDH are not important.\nBased on my limited understanding of the theory, these are potentially valid mechanisms to explain the IDH pattern. Again, I am probably wrong in some aspects of my logic (see Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s conclusions in his blog, logic and intuition is always a guide that has to be treated with caution). That said, I also approach IDH in my community ecology class as a community ecology zombie. I base my argument, however, on the Mackey and Currie (2001), which empirically shows that, despite these valid mechanisms, in general the IDH pattern is not that prevalent in nature and thus swamped by other processes.\nThis is also the reason why I thought that my field course students would not find an IDH-like pattern, and proved me wrong.

E.g. The Forsaken Garden by Nancy Ryley - I just started reading this book, about a CBC documentary filmmaker who got struck with \u0026ldquo;environmental illness\u0026rdquo; in the 70\u0026rsquo;s at the height of her career. She eventually had to move from Toronto to the mountains in Western Canada to escape the environmental contaminants that made her sick. During her recovery process, she got deep into environmental issues and environmental philosophy, and started seeing her own illness as a reflection of \u0026ldquo;the soul-sickness of the planet\u0026rdquo;Lots of other examples that back up the old adage \u0026ldquo;We are what we eat (and drink, and breathe, \u0026hellip;)\u0026ldquo;Beyond the individual human condition, is the collective human condition. Lots of examples and ideas in the fields of ecofeminism and environmental justice that examine this link, between human populations and the environment\nSentence 2: \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;conservation and development projects should be able to achieve both ecological and social progress without detracting from their primary objectives.\u0026rdquo;\nI agree with the underlying sentiment (that the wellbeing of humans and other-than-human can go hand-in-hand), but I think buried in some of these words (\u0026ldquo;development\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;social progress\u0026rdquo;) are assumptions that need to be unpacked\n\u0026ldquo;Development\u0026rdquo; - I have a couple of friends with undergraduate degrees in International Development, and from conversations with them, I have begun to see the problem with this term. \u0026ldquo;Development\u0026rdquo; implies that there is a course of growth that countries are supposed to follow\u0026ndash;that \u0026ldquo;underdeveloped\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;developing\u0026rdquo; nations are sub-par, and that they need to improve and change to reach the \u0026ldquo;developed\u0026rdquo; standard (i.e. us). It implies that they have not reached that standard yet, and we can help them reach it. While it is true that we have easy access to basic necessities and abundant luxuries and they don\u0026rsquo;t, and we should be equalizing the distribution of resources and power, what messages do we perpetuate when we operate with the mindframe that we are developed, and they are not? I think we need to critically examine the positionality and assumptions underpinning the term \u0026ldquo;development\u0026rdquo;, as well as the nature of the development projects themselves. To paraphrase one friend: \u0026ldquo;Development\u0026rdquo; assumes that we have a lot to teach them, to develop them, when really, we could do well to stop and listen and learn from them\u0026ldquo;Social progress\u0026rdquo; - what does this mean? When I read this sentence, I gather that social progress is an outcome of development projects. So, the assumption here is that developed nations are socially more progressive than developing nations. While this may be true in some important ways (democracy, freedom of speech, etc.), it may also be false in other important ways (the way we treat our elders, our bodies, view death, etc.). Those are just some examples, and I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that \u0026ldquo;developing\u0026rdquo; nations do those things perfectly\u0026ndash;actually, I have no idea, probably some do it better than others\u0026ndash;but I am saying that it is dangerous to assume that the \u0026ldquo;developed\u0026rdquo; society is the more mature, or in better condition, or more conducive to human well-being, than the \u0026ldquo;less developed\u0026rdquo; society\nI am sure that these words are used with the best of intentions\u0026ndash;I believe that most people who use these words have the genuine desire and compassion to change the inequalities that exist. But we need to use them critically. The glaring assumption I see in this text is: we have it better than they do, and we have to help them progress into us. While this is true in basic ways (we have clean water, food, shelter, rights, etc. and it is not fair that they don\u0026rsquo;t and we should work to make things fair), it is an attitude that can lead to a kind of arrogance and perpetuation of the power difference that caused the inequality in the first place. What does it mean to \u0026ldquo;help the less fortunate\u0026rdquo;? Though used with well meaning, what preconceptions and assumptions are carried by that phrase? Is there a better way to talk about the injustices that exist, and the genuine efforts to reveal and dissolve them?\nSentence 3: \u0026ldquo;Whereas \u0026lsquo;win-win\u0026rsquo; projects that achieve both conservation and economic gains are a commendable goal, they are not easy to attain.\u0026rdquo;\nI recognize that abstracts don\u0026rsquo;t tell the whole story; many abstracts are constrained by word limits and hence stripped of nuance. But how did \u0026ldquo;win-win\u0026rdquo; between the human condition and environmental condition (from the 1st sentence) suddenly become \u0026ldquo;win-win\u0026rdquo; between conservation and economic gains? Specifically, how did the human condition (from the 1st sentence) become equated with development and social progress (2nd sentence), and finally with  economic gains (3rd sentence)?It may well be that monetary stability is an important component of human well-being, but aren\u0026rsquo;t there other priorities too? Happiness, good relationships, a sense of belonging, a sense of self, to name a few\u0026hellip;\nMaybe in some cases it is appropriate to use monetary wealth as a measure of human well-being, but this proxy should not be used a priori. What messages are perpetuated when we do so? What kind of citizenry is produced when we continue to automatically and unquestioningly equate \u0026ldquo;economic gain\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;the human condition\u0026rdquo;?Well now that I\u0026rsquo;ve got this out, maybe I can proceed to Sentence 4\u0026hellip;\n","date":1312561320,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1312561320,"objectID":"23bf700867b338fdf81970ba5070f79f","permalink":"/post/trying-to-read-an-article.../","publishdate":"2011-08-05T16:22:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/trying-to-read-an-article.../","section":"post","summary":"Karl recently cited this PNAS article in his blog post about the link between environment and society.

There is probably some great literature on this, both quantitative and qualitative, but given my personal preferences, this article that recently appeared in PNAS (Motivating voter turnout by invoking the self by Bryan et al.), has a clue to answering one of these three questions. In a real experiment, they asked potential voters how importing voting is for them, but with two experimental conditions:\n\u0026ldquo;In each experiment, participants completed one of two versions of a brief survey. In one version, a short series of questions referred to voting using a self-relevant noun (e.g., “How important is it to you to be a voter in the upcoming election?”); in the other, questions that were otherwise identical referred to voting using a verb (e.g., “How important is it to you to vote in the upcoming election?”).\u0026rdquo;Based on previous research:\n\u0026ldquo;So we hypothesized that using a predicate noun (e.g., “to be a voter”) as opposed to a verb (e.g., “to vote”) to refer to participation in an upcoming election would create a greater interest in and likelihood of performing that behavior—registering to vote and voting. If this hypothesis were confirmed, it would be evidence for the more general theoretical idea that simply framing a future behavior as a way to claim a desired identity can motivate that behavior.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;This simple difference in three words (\u0026ldquo;to be voter\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;to vote\u0026rdquo;) increased the actual, measured, voting by more than 10%! Now if we combine this amazing result with an assumption that it is easier for somebody to self-identify with a story about somebody else versus a graph or a statistic, I think that the starting hypothesis to the question \u0026ldquo;Which one is the most memorable?\u0026rdquo;, is the qualitative piece of information. Whether this makes it also more true, and consequently more relevant, is still a completely different matter.\nThe results of this study also have other implications, though. One of the basic tenets in course design are learning objectives (see for instance this document from the University of Guelph). I advocates SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely)\u0026nbsp;verbs. The document already stresses the importance of writing them from the student\u0026rsquo;s perspective, which makes it easier for the students to self-identify with them, but how about a study that randomly divides a class in two, and one half of the students get the learning objectives with action verbs, the other half with action nouns. Would this also result in a 10% increase in learner outcomes?\n","date":1312455900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1312455900,"objectID":"302a28d34fd822688cbb01547186ac0d","permalink":"/post/three-words-a-world-of-difference/","publishdate":"2011-08-04T11:05:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/three-words-a-world-of-difference/","section":"post","summary":"I am teaching a field course in Algonquin this summer, and I \u0026ldquo;stress\u0026rdquo;, i.e. grade, two components of field work during this course: a group science project, and an individual natural history project.

The latest is an article by Steven Shapin in the London Review of Books, The Darwin Show. He synthesized 14 (fourteen!) books that appeared around the celebration of his 200th birthday in 2009. In it, he explores a lot of interesting themes, and one of the main ones revolves around why this is such a big deal. Summarizing his synthesis would do injustice to his tour-de-force, but I want to focus on one argument Shapin makes, and this is related to the distinction people normally make between natural history and scientific method, artists versus scientists, qualitative versus quantitative:\n\u0026ldquo;Artists create; scientists discover. That’s our usual understanding of the thing, and scientists – together with some of their philosophical allies – have been in the van of insisting so. (That’s one way in which ‘relativism’ and ‘social constructivism’ are commonly opposed.) If science is discovery and not invention, then it follows that discoverers’ relation to what they reveal is different in both intellectual texture and moral resonance from Mozart’s relation to his operas, Shakespeare’s to his plays, and even Bush’s to his wars. You couldn’t say of\u0026nbsp;Figaro\u0026nbsp;or\u0026nbsp;Lear\u0026nbsp;or the Iraq war that they were waiting there to be ‘discovered’. ‘Something of that sort’ may well have come into being, but an example of ‘something like’\u0026nbsp;Figaro\u0026nbsp;is Salieri’s\u0026nbsp;Axur, Re d’Ormus\u0026nbsp;or even Abba’s ‘Waterloo’. \u0026ldquo;\u0026nbsp;Shapin argues that this is only true to a certain extent:\n\u0026ldquo;You can still say, with perfect accuracy, that the\u0026nbsp;Origin\u0026nbsp;is much more than its ‘essential’ theory of natural selection: it is a book, a magnificent theatre of persuasion, ‘one long argument’ (as Darwin called it), supported by masses of arduously compiled evidence, ingeniously organised and vouched for by a special individual, with known special virtues and capacities. [\u0026hellip;]\u0026nbsp;Wallace himself was well aware that it was one thing to come up with a theory but a much greater thing to make it credible: he thought of himself as a mere ‘guerrilla chief’ of evolution while Darwin was ‘the great general’, mapping out the grand literary and political strategy to make natural selection stick in the culture.\u0026ldquo;\u0026nbsp;No matter what we \u0026ldquo;discover\u0026rdquo;, we also always have to present this discovery, and this aspect is also creative, and one of the the reasons why we celebrate Darwin and not Wallace. This \u0026ldquo;presentation\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;creation\u0026rdquo; has several important consequences, though. The article looks at some personality influences on his theoretical exploration of evolution and the writing of his books, and also on how his ideas have been used in very different contexts to further agendas of scientists and social movements (maybe something that Ingrid will explore to a certain extent in her PhD work).\nOne other consequence of this presentation of discovery is that it shapes, implicitly or explicitly, the discoveries we are trying to make. Take for instance our \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; definition of rareness of a species in a community.\nAnother example of how presentation can shape a discovery is the discussion I am having with Ingrid on a figure that can form the basis of some of her PhD ideas. Ingrid started it by presenting this figure (details are not important, yet):\nI transformed it because I think there is not enough structure in the figure: the actors (bubbles) are differentiated from each other, the influences (arrows) are different depending on the actors they connect, and there is not a real focal point. So I transformed it into this:Ingrid\u0026rsquo;s main problems with this presentation are the hierarchical nature, focusing on the differences and not the similarities, elimination of certain influences. Our discussion than drifted to feminism versus\u0026nbsp;patriarchal\u0026nbsp;dominance structures, which are always fun discussions to have. But the main point is that these two presentation are related to the same \u0026ldquo;discovery\u0026rdquo;, but have very different meanings to the creator and to the reader. You could argue that me shoehorning Ingrid\u0026rsquo;s general picture into a specific structure will prevent me from finding potentially key influences, I can argue that Ingrid\u0026rsquo;s general picture does not provide the reader an explicit guide through her thinking.\u0026nbsp;The importance is not who is correct, but 1) finding arguments to justify a presentation, and 2) to be very aware of the consequences (advantages and limitations) of a certain presentation, as is illustrated by the synthesis of Shapin and our new definition of rareness.ps: we finally solved Ingrid\u0026rsquo;s problem with my hierarchical concept map by \u0026hellip; making the concept go from left to right instead of bottom to top!

Only in 1 application, however, did the new approach result in a successful, measurable, conservation result.\u0026nbsp;In this scenario, the successful conservation effort was driven by charismatic, Tom Nudds-like figure (the face with the pony tail in the screenshot ;-), conservation officer. At the end of this study, I present the results at the usual scientific conferences, highlighting the success rate of only 1%, and thus the fact that our proposed importance of deep community is not as successful as we anticipated. At the same time, the conservation officer also hits the conference road, illustrating the success of her project that was built on our proposed mechanism.\u0026nbsp;\nIn this scenario, there is obviously a tension between quantitative (1%) and qualitative (the success story) data. Which one is most memorable, most true, most relevant? We are not out of that discussion yet, but we have another 4 years to work on that.\nHowever, you can find examples of this everywhere once you are aware of this tension (and Ingrid\u0026rsquo;s thesis is definitely making me aware of a lot of different things).

She compares the behaviour of Murdoch-owned newspaper to Speedy, a robot from an Asimov story that finds a pool with some essential elements for his survival.\u0026ldquo;Speedy\u0026rsquo;s problem, it\u0026rsquo;s revealed, is that two of the Laws of Robotics programmed into him are contradicting one another. One of the laws, the need to protect himself, has locked horns with another law, the one that compels him to perform his mission. It\u0026rsquo;s almost as if he were a news outlet covering its owner during an extremely embarrassing time.Speedy is driven mad by the dilemma. He starts to sing Gilbert and Sullivan songs, ramble and spout non sequiturs, and he would have made a fine edition to the Wall Street Journal editorial board this week.\u0026rdquo;So now I have these two pieces of information dealing with the same issue, one qualitative, on quantitative.

Down the hall, Barack Obama and David Cameron’s big ones were applauded while Stephen Harper’s small one was jeered./o:pThey were all speaking, of course, of marine protected areas (get your mind out of the gutter) at last month’s Second International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC2) in Victoria, BC. This year’s edition of IMCC was located rather conveniently near where I now live on Vancouver Island.Like everyone else in attendance, the two old academics were attempting to communicate an idea, an opinion, or—seemingly too often at this conference—a cry for political sanity. Whether it was an activist, government scientist, graduate student, or academic, all of the nearly 2000 conference participants all wrestled with the same issue—being able to make a compelling case that fellow scientists and the general public are willing to listen to. To make marine science matter (which incidentally, was the theme of IMCC2) … a surprisingly difficult task in in an age of information overload and distraction. Also, bad news in a time global marine decline./o:pAnd despite what I feel was a small piece of comic genius…/o:p/o:p…my own presentation didn’t deviate from the standard presentation format. And for my first time ‘round, I’m perfectly fine with that. I now have an appreciation of variety of ways we can effectively engage each other and the public. And engage we must. /o:pLuckily the folks from Google and NAMPAN were on hand with some neat tools that I think will help scientists and the public to interact in ways that are accessible, visually appealing and have the power to convey powerful messages and communicate the scale of current marine ecosystem decline./o:p-Google ran daily seminars on integrating marine research findings into the google earth/ocean platform to communicate marine issues. The seminars played to packed crowds. With marine spatial planning a key component of most presentations, I have a feeling that google earth might change the way marine spatial planners communicate with the public./o:p-NAMPAN (North American Marine Protected Areas Network - one of the products of NAFTA), also brought along some fantastic tools. In addition to having some of their own nifty maps and interactive tools, NAMPAN presented a process for creating easy to understand ecological report cards that are based on clearly defined criteria. The annual report card on the status of Chesapeake Bay has become such a success that it now runs on the front page of the Washington Post every New Year’s Day and has become a call to arms amongst the general public and local decision makers./o:pAs visual creatures, these tools will allow NGOs, grad students, etc. to stand alongside the most seasoned academics and government scientists and tell compelling and visually appealing stories to not just the scientific community, but also to non-scientists. Making the science matter. When it comes to marine science, this move away from typical, jargon dense and technical presentations is an absolute necessity (the worst offender at IMCC2 used text dense slides to suggest “an adaptive multi-scalable interdisciplinary framework approach” which uses a new “knowledge system” and “theoretical construct” to create “resilience in place” and a “way to move forward”). Much of the work in the marine conservation field stretches far beyond that of the scientific community and often has both social and ecological consequences. Having the tools to start communicating findings to a diverse audience is a step in right direction. An informed public is more likely to demand more from decision makers and is likely to become involved in things like citizen science. /o:pAt IMCC2 I attended a day long pre-conference workshop on marine citizen science —a powerful tool for not only engaging the public (school kids, fishermen, hikers, retirees, divers, etc.) but to also generate high volumes of low cost observational data. Despite some logistical challenges, the programs have been highly successful, creating long term, information rich datasets. In addition to the audience reached by typical scientific publications, the audience reached by of word of mouth from the citizen scientists who collected the data was vast and engaged communities… making marine science matter to non-scientists./o:pIn a recent post, Karl wrote on the social benefits of conservation and the value of evaluating the successes and failures of conservation initiatives. One of the sources of failure cited in several conservation projects in Tallis et al. (2008) was a lack of communication infrastructure. Successful projects, on the other hand, informed the public of they were doing and why conservation mattered, backing it up with sound science. /o:pDuring my time in the Cottenie Lab I spent a lot of time grappling with how scientists choose to communicate and engage with the public. As I move to the next stage in my post-undergrad career I have a feeling that this type of communication will become a central theme. Beginning this August I’ll be starting a seven month internship with the Coady Institute. I’m heading down to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to help facilitate the creation of a network of marine protected areas. I’ll be working with scientists, governments and communities to create a stable transition to alternative income sources and to track biological change in protected areas. A large part of the project will entail communicating that marine reserves are effective and the economic benefits of restoring ecosystem services are worth it. In other words, (you guessed it) making the science matter.\n","date":1309463760,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1309463760,"objectID":"1e921a5e83b681301c02452278b7f442","permalink":"/post/making-science-matter/","publishdate":"2011-06-30T19:56:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/making-science-matter/","section":"post","summary":"Recently, I found myself eavesdropping on two elderly fellows debating an age-old question: does size matter?

Because approximately at the same time that the above article crossed my (virtual) desk, I came across these two articles related to the placebo effect.\nA recent article in the Guardian mentioned a German study that looked at the placebo effect, and noted:\u0026ldquo;The report says placebos, from vitamin pills to homeopathic remedies or even sham surgery, can prove highly effective in various treatments.\u0026nbsp;In Bavaria, it found, 88% of GPs have sent patients home with prescriptions for placebo drugs.\u0026rdquo;\nHere is a more technical quote from a recent article on the placebo effect:\u0026ldquo;In this paper, examples will be given where physiological or pathological conditions are altered following the administration of an inert substance or verbal instructions tailored to induce expectation of a change, and explanations will be offered with details on neurotransmitter changes and neural pathways activated.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother well-written review of the placebo effect from Wired magazine connects these two dots, \u0026ldquo;test whether they are correct\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;placebo\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026ldquo;What all of these disorders have in common, however, is that they engage the higher cortical centers that generate beliefs and expectations, interpret social cues, and anticipate rewards. So do chronic pain, sexual dysfunction, Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s, and many other ailments that respond robustly to placebo treatment. To avoid investing in failure, researchers say, pharmaceutical companies will need to adopt new ways of vetting drugs that route around the brain\u0026rsquo;s own centralized network for healing.\u0026rdquo;So in essence, what turned out to be a very theoretical discussion down the rabbit hole (switching from a definition from science to a definition to an explicit definition of the word \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo;), is of crucial importance to the pharmaceutical industry, and thus influences our every day life. The definition they use for \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; when testing drugs or procedures is not \u0026ldquo;curing something\u0026rdquo;, but is more precisely \u0026ldquo;curing something without your own knowledge\u0026rdquo;. This, on the one hands, seems very reasonable, because you only want to pay for a very expensive medicine if it is effective. On the other hand, we, as potential users of these science results, only care about the \u0026ldquo;curing something\u0026rdquo; part \u0026hellip;\u0026nbsp;\n\n\n","date":1307373120,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1307373120,"objectID":"e2867d2137f6030a6877ddfd63e45990","permalink":"/post/the-scientific-method-and-our-health/","publishdate":"2011-06-06T15:12:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-scientific-method-and-our-health/","section":"post","summary":"There are several ways to define \u0026ldquo;science\u0026rdquo;, but here is very basic one byEdzard Ernst, the first professor in \u0026nbsp;Alternative Medicine, in an interview in Science:\n\u0026ldquo;I was also convinced that scientists need to be critical and sceptical, and that if you apply science to any field you don\u0026rsquo;t want to prove that your ideas are correct, you want to test whether they are correct.\u0026rdquo;While I probably have to check his own summary of his scientific legacy (\u0026rdquo;I found that homeopathy is pretty useless.","tags":["news","science","serendipity"],"title":"The scientific method and our health","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip; or ecology meet TED.\n\n","date":1306939020,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1306939020,"objectID":"baaf67358b97727c5dafb58cae963feb","permalink":"/post/complexity.../","publishdate":"2011-06-01T14:37:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/complexity.../","section":"post","summary":"\u0026hellip; or ecology meet TED.","tags":["science","fun"],"title":"Complexity...","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The end of the semester is always hectic.

However, the comparison of different groups of organisms has been hampered by differences in sampling design, spatial scales or the environmental variables involved. Our aim was to test how dispersal ability affects metacommunity structure and associated species distributions by sampling different species groups in the same plots to avoid these problems. Location Western Carpathian Mountains (Europe). Methods In 191 fens we sampled the composition of diatom, bryophyte, vascular plant and mollusc assemblages, water chemistry, and macroclimatic data. We then generated spatial variables covering all relevant spatial scales using analysis of principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM). We applied the adjusted variation partitioning algorithm to quantify the effects of environment and space. Results Pure effects of water chemistry and space were highly significant for all groups of organisms. Spatial effects were stronger for groups with larger propagules (vascular plants, molluscs) than for those with smaller propagules (diatoms, bryophytes). Assemblages of macroscopic bryophytes were structured slightly less by geography and much more by environment than were those of microscopic diatoms. Vascular plant and mollusc assemblages turned out to be more spatially structured (as compared to diatom and bryophyte assemblages), with small differences between the two groups. Coarse-scale spatial effects dominated in the bryophyte metacommunity, while in the other groups, including diatoms, finer-scale effects were also important. Main conclusions Given that our analyses are based on a standardized sampling and analytical framework, our findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that both environmental and spatial variables structure metacommunities of organisms with very different dispersal abilities, including microscopic diatoms. In addition, we show for the first time that the strengths of these effects and their scale dependence may be predicted using important trait differences between organisms, for example differences in propagule size.","tags":["metacommunity","dispersal","species sorting","Bryophytes","diatoms","environmental filtering","fen","molluscs","spatial scale","vascular plants"],"title":"Environmental and spatial controls of biotic assemblages in a discrete semi-terrestrial habitat: comparison of organisms with different dispersal abilities sampled in the same plots","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nIf I could meet any person, dead or alive, real or fiction, I think one of my top choices would be Steve Irwin. I\u0026rsquo;d want to meet him out in the bush, maybe in Australia, maybe help him re-locate a croc. Afterwards, we might talk about conservation and peace and wilderness. Or, more accurately, he\u0026rsquo;d talk, and I\u0026rsquo;d just nod vigorously in agreement while reveling in his radiance.\nSteve Irwin is famously known for his larger-than-life television series Crocodile Hunter. It\u0026rsquo;s a misnomer because the show isn\u0026rsquo;t about hunting crocodiles. What actually happens on the show is: Steve goes into the bush; he meets wildlife; we, in turn, meet wildlife. Steve\u0026rsquo;s excitement is contagious, his animal senses obvious, and his huge heart very genuine. When asked why he decided to create a TV show, he said he wanted to bring these wild animals into people\u0026rsquo;s living rooms. He wanted people to get to know these wild animals, one-on-one, face-to-face. If people get to know them, they will start to care about them. If they care about them, they will start to love them. And \u0026ldquo;people save what they love\u0026rdquo;.\n(We can discuss the connotations of the word \u0026ldquo;save\u0026rdquo; as it relates to the environment, but that is for another post.)\nAn activist and self-described \u0026ldquo;Wildlife Warrior\u0026rdquo;, Steve believed wholeheartedly in the fight for nature. But rather than handing out moral prescriptions about the changes humans need to make, he strove simply to breed compassion for wildlife, believing that this is key to positive action. Steve travelled to all corners of the earth with a camera crew, meeting animals, falling in love with them, ultimately wanting us to do the same. His motive was to inspire people to act out of love.\nLove. This word doesn\u0026rsquo;t get used a lot by scientists and ecologists. When it appears in a science context, it is usually being dissected into its chemical components. Detected by electrodes and measured with machines, this is a very different sort of love than Steve\u0026rsquo;s.\nNor does it get used a lot by environmental ethicists. When it appears in an environmental ethics context, it is usually being denied. Like scientists, ethicists and philosophers use reason and logic to work through a problem and draw conclusions. Love, being soft and subjective, would taint a convincing philosophical argument. So mainstream environmental ethicists (such as Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Paul Taylor) are careful to present themselves as unattached, objective philosophers. Adamantly, they are not animal lovers, but rational beings, using sound, unbiased logic to moralize about the proper treatment of nature.\nThere is a sense that activists are allowed to be overt in their emotional attachment to nature, but academics aren\u0026rsquo;t. It is moving and inspirational when Steve Irwin announces his love for nature and invites us to love with him; it is naive and almost laughable when academics do it. There is a sense that love confounds intelligence, so the likes of Peter Singer steer clear of love professionally. Ecologists, too.\nArne Naess\n\nBut, environmental philosopher Arne Naess speaks up for love. He draws on Kant\u0026rsquo;s contrast of \u0026ldquo;moral acts\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;beautiful acts\u0026rdquo;. A moral act is something we do because moral law dictates that it is the right thing. A beautiful act is something we do that is congruent with moral law, but mostly we do it because we want to. Put simply, both are right acts, but a moral act is done out of duty, while a beautiful act is done out of love. Arne Naess further explains:\nIf we do what is right because of positive inclination, then, according to Kant, we perform a beautiful act. My point is that in environmental affairs we should primarily try to influence people toward beautiful acts by finding ways to work on their inclinations rather than their morals. Unhappily, the extensive moralizing within the ecological movement has given the public the false impression that they are primarily asked to sacrifice, to show more responsibility, more concern, and better morals. As I see it we need the immense variety of sources of joy opened through increased sensitivity toward the richness and diversity of life, through the profound cherishing of free natural landscapes.\nArne Naess wants people to treat nature better because they want to, and not because they are obliged to. When we do things out of obligation, there is an attached sentiment of guilt and anxiety. When we do things out of love, there is beauty. Mainstream environmental ethics appeals to people\u0026rsquo;s sense of duty, and Arne Naess questions the sustainability of this tactic. Duty on its own is not enough. People need to experience the thing that they are being dutiful towards, to feel love and joy for it.\nMainstream environmental ethics has made much headway in rationalising the ethical treatment of nature, and this work is necessary. But if we are to follow Arne Naess\u0026rsquo; advice, then perhaps we need to relax the tradition that emotion negates the credibility of an academic. If academics want to take part in creating an environmentally ethical world of beautiful acts, then we have to make our love for nature more obvious. We have to take it out of the closet and share it with the world.\nWhile it may be true that love befuddles logic, love is also one of the greatest motivators of personal change. Furthermore, as my professor Bob Jickling writes, \u0026ldquo;Love is not soft, it is honest.\u0026rdquo; Love needn\u0026rsquo;t detract from credibility, and in fact, credibility grows with the honesty in admitting love. It seems to me that ecologists and environmental philosophers do share an immense love of nature. It seems to me that we all have a little Steve Irwin inside of us.

Last December, a friend convinced me to not only go see Avatar on the big screen, but to watch it in 3-D with her. I was blown away. Though I find the current 3-D craze to be, well, crazy, I have to admit that it brought a certain enchantment to the fantasy planet Pandora. The Pandoran world teems with all the weird and wonderful biota that make for an ecologist\u0026rsquo;s paradise: giant plants that spiral and luminesce, majestic birds soaring and battling in the sky, delicate spores pulsing through the air like tiny jellyfish.\nBut special effects aside, the movie is first and foremost an insightful commentary on the danger and devastation of human arrogance. Writer and director James Cameron tells the classic and still-very-relevant tale of white man exploiting Native land for gold. A love story is central (of course), and it is the budding romance between American Jake Sully and Pandoran Neytiri that sparks complication and hope.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t spoil the movie, but what I want to focus on here is one of Jake\u0026rsquo;s first encounters with the Native Pandoran people. (He was assigned to befriend them and learn their ways with the ultimate goal of pushing them off a desired tract of land.) Jake acquires the attention of Mo\u0026rsquo;at, the clan\u0026rsquo;s matriarch. She is initially angry, demanding that he go away, expressing her frustration at how his people just don\u0026rsquo;t understand. But Jake persists, imploring that she teach him and that maybe she can make him understand. I found the next bit of dialogue extremely telling:\nMo\u0026rsquo;at: It is hard to fill a cup that is already full.Jake: My cup is empty. Trust me. Just ask Dr. Augustine. I\u0026rsquo;m no scientist.\nTwo points of interest emerge for me. The first is that scientists know. Jake makes it clear that scientists\u0026rsquo; cups may be full, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall under that camp (he is actually an ex-Marine). To be fair, a good scientist knows that they actually know very little. A good scientist knows that what they know today can be disproved tomorrow, and that uncertainty underlies the entire discipline. So I think there is a noteworthy disconnect between the public perception and the actual practice of science. But, that said, I think there is some truth to the stereotype, too. There is no denying that science is strictly rooted in the rational acquirement of knowledge. Scientists know what they are looking for (objective knowledge), and they know how to find it (through hypothetico-deductive reasoning). Their cups are definitely full in this sense.\nThis leads to the second point of interest: knowing can exclude possibilities. When one enters the world knowing what they are looking for and how to find it, they will not find anything else. When a scientist approaches the world as a scientist only, they will see scientific possibilities only. When \u0026ldquo;white man\u0026rdquo; enters Native land knowing what he wants\u0026ndash;its riches, he will miss much of what\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026ndash;its richness.\nTo take another spin on this theme, we can turn to an environmental ethics paper by environmental philosophers Jim Cheney and Anthony Weston. They explore the relationship between what we know (epistemology) and how we act (ethics). They propose an \u0026ldquo;ethics-based epistemology\u0026rdquo; as an alternative to our traditional \u0026ldquo;epistemology-based ethics\u0026rdquo;. This is a mouthful, but as my classmate Andy put it so succinctly, it boils down to the chicken-or-egg riddle about what comes first:\nIn the traditional view, epistemology comes first: what we know about something determines how we act towards it. For example, we know that some animals can feel pain, so we decide upon this fact that we should treat them ethically.\nIn the alternative view, ethics come first: how we act towards something determines what we find out about it. In other words, we first act ethically, extending moral consideration and courtesy to even those that we know little about, and it is through this unconditional acceptance that we are allowed to really know the subject. So even if we cannot prove that snails feel pain, or that ecosystems exhibit stability, integrity, and beauty, or that wilderness matters intrinsically, we can show care and compassion for them anyway. We do not necessarily need to know all the facts before we can act in a caring manner. And, perhaps it is by caring first that knowledge and truth are revealed. By simply spending time and sharing space with other subjects, exercising mindfulness but resting our full minds, we invite unbridled discovery.\nEssentially, the alternative view calls us to enter with empty cups. It calls us to let go of our need to know, to free ourselves of agendas, to quiet our preconceptions and open ourselves to surprise. Like the character Mo\u0026rsquo;at, Jim Cheney and Anthony Weston question our fixation with evidence, fact, and objectivity. They suggest emptying our cups so that other possibilities are free to flow in.\n\nThe alternative view has some implications for science and ecology. My thinking on this is still in-progress (and probably will continue to be for a long time), and I pose the following questions in the spirit of re-imagining ecology through open dialogue:\n- When an ecologist conducts their research with a set agenda\u0026ndash;to acquire objective, scientific knowledge\u0026ndash;what possibilities are being excluded?\n- Like the \u0026ldquo;white man\u0026rdquo; who enters wanting riches, is the ecologist, wanting objective knowledge, overlooking richness? (And by richness I of course mean something very different from \u0026ldquo;species richness\u0026rdquo;.) Even if the scientist has the best of intentions in seeking objective knowledge, might he or she be (unknowingly) fueling arrogance and ignorance by fixating on one way of knowing?\n- Of course, it is the ecologist\u0026rsquo;s job to provide impartial knowledge. But this does not necessarily have to exclude other kinds of understandings that he or she may bear witness to. What if these other ways of knowing were embraced by the academic community, and offered a more central place in ecology than their current peripheral status?\n- What if ecologists were encouraged to tell about scientific findings as well as other, more personal findings, whatever that may be? What if we openly raise the status of personal findings, embracing all the contradictions and mystery that may tag along? Might that contribute more truthfully and fruitfully (albeit more messily) to our on-going vital task of deciding how to value the environment?\n- What if we, as an academic discipline, validated field work not just as a place to collect samples (i.e. the field is an object\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;our study site\u0026rdquo;), but also as a place that you can form a relationship with (i.e. the field is a subject)? Like a relationship with any other subject, it takes time and a certain leap of faith before one can truly appreciate the other\u0026rsquo;s depth, complexities, and value. Like any other loving relationship, sometimes the lover knows things that others do not. What if we took seriously the things that an ecologist knows about nature through love?\n- It seems that many ecologists do feel an emotional connection with nature and value their time in the field for non-scientific reasons. But it is always the science that gets the professional stamp of approval, never the love or joy. Does it have to be this way? Might we be losing richness by always shelving love and joy in order to display objectivity?\n- Ecologists and conservation biologists are valued in society for the impartial knowledge that they can contribute. They take part in environmental decision-making processes by providing the objective results of their research. However, it is often the case that the scientist cannot produce certain pieces of information, for a variety of reasons (lack of time, logistical problems, unforeseen circumstances, etc.). What if we implemented the alternative \u0026ldquo;ethics first\u0026rdquo; view, and chose the more caring and compassionate option despite not having all the facts?\n- Ecologists are scientists, but are we just scientists? Might we benefit from trying to understand the world through other lenses besides the scientific one?\n- If ecologists (and academics in general) more frequently approached the world with empty (or at least emptier) cups, I wonder what possibilities might flow in.\n","date":1290178680,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1290178680,"objectID":"45e438735555705fce1dc266cc3d5a52","permalink":"/post/empty-cups/","publishdate":"2010-11-19T14:58:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/empty-cups/","section":"post","summary":"Very occasionally, I will brave North American culture and go see a movie on a ridiculously big screen with a ridiculously big bag of popcorn.

We can throw the numbers into the biggest computing clusters the world has ever seen and let statistical algorithms find patterns where science cannot.But what is the biggest problem about patterns? You will always find them, and nobody knows this better than Google. The irony of this article is that Google stands for everything that he claims is wrong with \u0026ldquo;conventional\u0026rdquo; science. Google test every new feature they implement, e.g. new gmail interface item\u0026nbsp;(see contributions in the discussion by leggett.org, responsible for the new design), or this\u0026nbsp;user interface design\u0026nbsp;. This is not always completely successful (think Google Wave, duh), but based on some articles about how Google works, the scientific method is embedded in the core of their\u0026nbsp;business\u0026nbsp;model.\u0026nbsp;This article, for instance, explains their overall strategy to improve their search algorithm:\nAt any moment, dozens of these changes are going through a well-oiled testing process. Google employs hundreds of people around the world to sit at their home computer and judge results for various queries, marking whether the tweaks return better or worse results than before. But Google also has a larger army of testers — its billions of users, virtually all of whom are unwittingly participating in its constant quality experiments. Every time engineers want to test a tweak, they run the new algorithm on a tiny percentage of random users, letting the rest of the site’s searchers serve as a massive control group. There are so many changes to measure that Google has discarded the traditional scientific nostrum that only one experiment should be conducted at a time. “On most Google queries, you’re actually in multiple control or experimental groups simultaneously,” says search quality engineer Patrick Riley. Then he corrects himself. “Essentially,” he says, “all the queries are involved in some test.” In other words, just about every time you search on Google, you’re a lab rat.\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s strategy is probably the most successful implementation of the scientific method that does not involve technology at its core.\nAnd what about the example that the author uses from biology?\nThe best practical example of this is the shotgun gene sequencing by J. Craig Venter. Enabled by high-speed sequencers and supercomputers that statistically analyze the data they produce, Venter went from sequencing individual organisms to sequencing entire ecosystems. In 2003, he started sequencing much of the ocean, retracing the voyage of Captain Cook. And in 2005 he started sequencing the air. In the process, he discovered thousands of previously unknown species of bacteria and other life-forms. If the words \u0026ldquo;discover a new species\u0026rdquo; call to mind Darwin and drawings of finches, you may be stuck in the old way of doing science. Venter can tell you almost nothing about the species he found. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what they look like, how they live, or much of anything else about their morphology. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have their entire genome. All he has is a statistical blip — a unique sequence that, being unlike any other sequence in the database, must represent a new species.So what can biology learn from Google in this instance? First, that identifying these \u0026ldquo;unique sequences\u0026rdquo; as potential species is based on a hypothesis, because there probably are a staggering amount of unique sequences in each genome. Second, that these new species are nothing but a hypothesis that has to be tested. Sadly enough (or lucky enough, depending on your point of view), we biologists do not have 91 million searches per day at our disposal to test these hypotheses, but still have to get in our boat and get wet.\nSo should science learn the scientific method from Google? It turns out that for some science writers/scientists, the answer is \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":1289831820,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1289831820,"objectID":"9eeac6b4120f36e506e84bbfc27dbf71","permalink":"/post/what-can-science-learn-from-google/","publishdate":"2010-11-15T14:37:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/what-can-science-learn-from-google/","section":"post","summary":"That is the finishing sentence from\u0026nbsp;this article.

Only 1\u0026frasl;3 of the students show up, which I anticipated by discussing that question since it is not a crucial part of the course. I have a starting concept map for the students, that has already taken care of the reduction and simplification part of a concept map (all the basic concepts are identified and extracted from the text book), the exercise for this class is to deepen the concept map by identifying and synthesizing the information to provide a complete answer to the question. I subdivide the class in 4 groups, and the students start by reading the question, initial concept map, text book. Of course half of the students are going over the notes for their various midterms they have that day, but there is some initial discussion going on. After 15 minutes, I ask the students to start writing their solution concept maps on whiteboards scattered throughout the class. Each group singles one person for this task, and they start the concept map.\n\nAnd then the magic happens: They start disagreeing, the second person comes up, erases part of the concept map, and starts her version, a third person does the same, the students start to look up from their midterm textbooks and pay attention, provide suggestions, more discussions, and before you know it\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; every single student is looking at the whiteboard, discussing, and thinking.\u0026nbsp;\n\nMy defining moment as a teacher (too bad I had to wait 5 years for this moment), and here are the pictures as proof.

It is the arrangement of them that showed a deeper and complete understanding of the problem, and as a class they needed 80 minutes to get to that point. The two main difficulties for this problem were 1) identifying the major hierarchy, and 2) 2 cross links between the two branches of the hierarchy.

I wasn\u0026rsquo;t involved in the issue myself, but knew a few people who rallied against this decision. They cited it as ironic evidence that feminism is far from being a finished movement. At the time, I only saw a superficial link between the Women\u0026rsquo;s Studies program cut and feminism; I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what feminism really was.\nNow that I am reading ecofeminist literature and gaining an understanding of this environmental philosophy, I am also beginning to really appreciate the feminist philosophy. Both ecofeminism and feminism have far broader impacts than the labels will have you perceive. In fact, they both have significant impacts for ecology and science.\nThe terms \u0026ldquo;ecofeminism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;feminism\u0026rdquo; tend to put people off. There is a connotation of radical outburst and civil disobedience, reserved for the very passionate and very outraged. While these may be the most visible parts of the movement, at the heart of it is simply a powerful argument about value dualities.\nThe story begins with two familiar dualities: Male/Female, and Reason/Emotion. The dualities are commonly viewed in parallel, with men being typically associated with reason and thinking, and women with emotion and feeling.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with noticing differences and contrasting two things that are different. The problem emerges when we start to value one more than the other. One is seen as superior, the other inferior. It becomes acceptable for one to dominate, control, and use the other. The problem emerges when we start treating the two as oppositional rather than complementary.\nThis happened to the Reason/Emotion duality, beginning with the advent of Western philosophy and carrying on (largely unnoticed) today. Western philosophy sees reason as the epitome of human existence. Reason is a sophisticated, high-order capacity, keeping us grounded from the whims of \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo; instinct and \u0026ldquo;mere\u0026rdquo; emotion. Without reason, we would be no better than our amoral (and inferior) counterparts on Earth\u0026ndash;that is, animals. The ability to reason is essentially what defines us as humans.\nEcofeminist Val Plumwood questions this definition:\nWhat is taken to be authentically and characteristically human, defining of the human, as well as the ideal for which humans should strive is notto be found in what is shared with the natural and animal (e.g., the body, sexuality, reproduction, emotionality, the senses, agency) but in what is thought to separate and distinguish them\u0026ndash;especially reason and its offshoots. Hence humanity is defined not as part of nature (perhaps a special part) but as separate from and in oposition to it. Thus the relation of humans to nature is treated as an oppositional and value dualism.\nWhy do we emphasize the traits that distinguish us from animals, but ignore those that we share with animals? Besides being thinking creatures, are we not also bodily creatures and feeling creatures? It is this conception of human, stressing our reason, our separateness from other animals, that breeds another parallel divide: Human/Nature.\nThese three dualities (Reason/Emotion, Male/Female, and Human/Nature) are inextricably linked. And ecofeminists assert that Western society\u0026rsquo;s obsession with reason has created the twin domination of women and nature. Obsession with reason has led us to highly value the \u0026ldquo;masculine\u0026rdquo; properties of thinking, distance, and abstraction, while degrading the \u0026ldquo;feminine\u0026rdquo; properties of feeling, affection, and experience. This oppressive framework results in the pervasive and subliminal message: nature and women cannot reason (at least not as well as men), therefore it is okay to dominate them.\nThis makes it okay for men to continually earn higher salaries than women. This makes it okay for humans to continually support animal abuse with every purchase of factory farmed meat. (I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to fault anyone for what they earn or what they eat; social constructs have allowed for certain habits and conveniences, certain ethics.)\nMore invisibly, this makes it okay for, say, an ecology professor (probably male, teaching a class of probably mostly females) to heavily embed critical thinking into his curriculum, without any effort to nurture his students\u0026rsquo; emotional connection with nature. This makes it okay for, say, an ecologist to publish a paper on riparian buffers and water quality, without addressing (either publicly or privately) the instrumentalisation of forest and trees into \u0026ldquo;riparian buffers\u0026rdquo; and water and lake into \u0026ldquo;water quality\u0026rdquo;.\nWhy do ecology students rarely get to go outside? Why are they only asked what they think about some ecosystem, community, or population, never what they feel for a particular place or subject? Why do ecologists study \u0026ldquo;natural resources\u0026rdquo; and not nature? (As if nature is only worth what it can provide for us.) Or \u0026ldquo;wildlife management\u0026rdquo; and not wildlife? (As if wildlife is ours to control, needing rules imposed on them when they show signs of disobedience.) These are real-world examples of our reason-dominated view, representing the widely accepted (even celebrated) norm in ecology.\nMale-biased views entrench our education system, perhaps most blatantly in university science departments. Caring and love are cast aside. Professors, with the best of intentions, teach us that these are \u0026ldquo;merely\u0026rdquo; emotions, unreliable and untrustworthy. A good student will channel these passions into something productive and respectable\u0026ndash;something rational.\nIt is not the ecofeminist or feminist\u0026rsquo;s intention to reduce the prestige of reason in Western society. Rather, they question why this must come at the expense of the prestige of emotion. Reason is undebatably an important and powerful defense against myth, superstition, and propaganda. It allows us to evaluate, reveal, and construct. The \u0026ldquo;voice of reason\u0026rdquo; lets us look past individual desires to a more objective stance. Reason can serve as a friendly invitation to explore divergent views.\nBut emotion has much value, too. Ecofeminists and feminists validate the role of care, compassion, empathy, and inclusivity in our ethics and in our lives. These emotions are undebatably important and powerful antidotes for insensitivity, callousness, and apathy. Emotion, too, allows us to evaluate, reveal, and construct. Heartfelt emotions like sympathy and love carry us back from abstract theory to personal experience. Like reason, emotion can serve as a friendly invitation to explore divergent views.\nTo be human is to both think and feel. Thinking and feeling are different and complementary modes of knowing. They keep each other in check: thinking pulls us back from irrationality; feeling pulls us back from blind rationality. Western philosophy presents thinking and feeling as at war, with thinking being the favoured winner. Ecofeminism and feminism reject this oppositional value duality. Thinking and feeling feed each other. The complementarity of emotion and reason is our best toolkit for understanding the world and deciding how we ought to live.\nThe paradox of ecology is that it recognizes the importance of nature and the strain that humans impose on nature. Yet it insists on operating under a reason-dominated framework (i.e. science and the hypothetico-deductive method) that subliminally and continually oppresses nature. To truly value nature (and women), we must first seriously re-consider the oppositional value dualities that have led to this oppression. Borrowing a symbol from Buddhist philosophy, this shift must take place:\n\nCaring and love should not be cast aside. They should be encouraged. I believe this encouragement can and should take place in an ecology classroom, right alongside encouraging critical thought and hypothetico-deductive reasoning. (Perhaps the traditional reason-dominated and male-biased classroom is a fundamental barrier against attracting and keeping women in science\u0026hellip;but that is another posting altogether.)\nReturning to the issue of the Women\u0026rsquo;s Studies program at Guelph, it is ironic indeed that a program giving voice to the value of emotion was single-handedly silenced by a reason-dominated institution. At the time, I was hard at work completing my Master of Science degree, writing about \u0026ldquo;riparian buffers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;water quality\u0026rdquo; within the impenetrable walls of the new Science Complex. I had no idea that I, too, was fueling the twin domination of women and nature. I found the loss of Women\u0026rsquo;s Studies unfortunate, but was largely oblivious to its heavy social implications.\nReading ecofeminist philosophy has really opened my eyes. Ecofeminism is only superficially about stopping animal cruelty and championing for women\u0026rsquo;s rights. It digs far deeper, revealing the oppositional value dualities that underscore our societal prejudices. This story does not only apply to women and nature, but virtually to every group that has faced discrimination (Aboriginal communities, disabled persons, LGBT, etc.). Ecofeminism sheds light on the shared history and shared challenges of many social and environmental problems.\nFor me, I am astonished to learn the tight links between social and environmental problems. I am also astonished to learn how much I did not learn in my years of science education. Thus, I am ever more convinced that we need stronger commitment to interdisciplinary education and research.

It goes on to explain that Environment Canada wants to determine the socio-economic value of the iconic arctic species. This includes things like the bear\u0026rsquo;s consumptive value, cultural value, scientific value, educational value, aesthetic value, existence value, and so on. How much does each \u0026ldquo;additional unit of polar bear\u0026rdquo; or each \u0026ldquo;additional hectare of habitat\u0026rdquo; bring to the nation?\nPresumably, EC wants to include the polar bear in the economic analysis of climate warming. For example, ice melt in the North will open waterways and allow oil drilling (money in), but it will deplete polar bear populations (possibly money out).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a revolutionary thought: polar bears (and the Arctic in general) aren\u0026rsquo;t just valuable in terms of what they are worth to us. They are valuable in and of themselves. This is the distinction between instrumental and intrinsic value, concepts central to the field of environmental ethics.\nIn this 2006 Nature article, McCauley critiques the growing trend of nature commodification. He asserts that ecologists and conservation biologists have \u0026ldquo;sold out on nature\u0026rdquo;. Under the concept of ecosystem services, we have put dollar values on wildlife and wilderness in order to validate their existence to a market-based society. This has indeed given nature some wins, but not in the long-term and not honestly. Furthermore, it relegates nature to a position of instrumentalized subordination.\nMcCauley is clear about his beliefs: \u0026ldquo;Nature has an intrinsic value that makes it priceless, and this is reason enough to protect it.\u0026rdquo; I tend to side with McCauley on this point, but I recognize that probably not all ecologists do, and probably not even all environmentalists do, and certainly not everyone does. The subject of nature\u0026rsquo;s value is irrelevant for some, highly emotional for others, and is loaded with assumptions that require serious questioning.\nMaybe polar bears are just worth their weight in meat. Maybe they are priceless. Maybe we should talk about it. Maybe the conversation should not be limited to environmental philosophers, but be open to everyone\u0026ndash;including ecologists, even if it means taking off our scientist hats and revealing our moral selves.\nWhy do ecologists\u0026rsquo; views matter on such a value-laden issue? Isn\u0026rsquo;t the job of ecologists to provide disinterested, impartial knowledge? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it someone else\u0026rsquo;s job to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s right and wrong?\nMy three-part response (which I hope to develop over the next semesters):\n1) Ecologists experience their study subjects or systems intimately. Their research usually includes field work, during which they spend time with nature, observe it, sometimes manipulate it. This process of studying nature facilitates the creation and strengthening of a relationship between the ecologist and the environment. I believe this relationship lets ecologists see, feel, and know things about nature that most other people do not have a chance to. Not just scientific things, but more abstract things that are learned from experiencing the natural world in a specific place and time. I believe this relationship bestows upon ecologists an additional responsibility (on top of their responsibilities as objective scientists) to actively think about and reveal assumptions that currently underlie society\u0026rsquo;s moral attitude towards nature.\n2) The public actually respects and will listen to scientists\u0026rsquo; opinions on environmental issues. Scientists hold a considerable degree of authority and are often sought for answers and solutions. Sometimes they are pushed beyond their sphere of expertise, for example, when they are asked to provide an answer to a moral question\u0026ndash;what should we do? As my professor Tom Nudds would warn, \u0026ldquo;Science takes part, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take sides,\u0026rdquo; and by taking sides, the scientist compromises him or herself as an objective figure.\nCorrect as it may be that science should not side with a particular outcome, I feel this is not a satisfactory response. It is not right for scientists to take sides and push personal agendas or opinions. But nor is it right for us to wash our hands of the moral issues at stake. I believe the stakes are too high for us to hide behind the veil of scientific impartiality.\nThe public wants to know what we ought to do; they are listening. Rather than become frustrated by their misunderstanding of science\u0026rsquo;s epistemological boundaries, I believe this is a call for ecologists to expand their horizons, communicate the distinction between science questions and \u0026ldquo;ought\u0026rdquo; questions, then engage in a conversation about the moral issues, assumptions, and values at play. This is a critical invitation to participate in the process of ethical inquiry. By doing so, we grow as educators, learners, and as a society.\n3) My hunch is that ecologists have strong feelings about nature\u0026rsquo;s value but currently lack the academic language and space to frame their environmental empathy. Over the years, ecologists have worked hard to move away from the sentimentality of natural history to the empiricism of a \u0026ldquo;hard science\u0026rdquo;. We assert that we are rational, not emotional. Quantitative, not qualitative. Ecologists, not environmentalists. We want to be taken seriously as scientists and in doing so, have divorced ourselves from the caring and compassion for nature that have led us to choose ecology as a vocation in the first place. I would bet that ecologists do have feelings for nature, and these feelings matter a lot when it comes to the pressing environmental issues of our time. I believe we need to validate them and talk about them responsibly and openly, and that this is one important avenue towards environmental and social wellbeing.I believe there is a way to discuss nature’s value intelligently, without compromising our objectivity as scientists, but also without compromising our selves as humans who care for the \u0026ldquo;more-than-human\u0026rdquo; world.\nPart of the solution lies in embracing ecology’s proximity to ethical issues. Rather than limit ecology to value-free science, we need to broaden ecology and borrow rhetoric and insights from fields that articulate moral, value-laden concepts. We need to create the academic space and support for ecologists to discuss those parts of their work that dip into non-science territory. I believe this would be a more fruitful endeavour than restricting our thinking to the value-free realm.\nAnd of course, this is the perfect excuse to post Churchill polar bear pictures.

This is my first post, and it comes at one of those in-between times in my life. I am in between finishing a two-month bike tour and starting a three- (or four, or more\u0026hellip;?) year PhD. It\u0026rsquo;s been an interesting process, returning from the tour and re-integrating back into society.\nFirst, a little about the tour. It was one of the best and most challenging things I have ever done. Almost two months after my return, I am still reflecting on all that I learned during this time.\nIt was organized by a group called The Otesha Project. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t your regular bike tour, but a \u0026ldquo;cycling and performing tour dedicated to youth empowerment and environmental sustainability through storytelling\u0026rdquo;. We put on a play in different towns and schools throughout Ontario, about the global impact of our everyday choices. More than a bike tour, we were a mobile community that aimed to educate youth, promote critical thinking, and question assumptions.\n\nHere are some things I had never done before the two months:\nI had never been on a bike tour. I had never acted on stage (discounting guest lectures?)\n I had never biked 100+km in a day, never biked with a trailer, never biked with such a sore and spent body.I had never biked with such high high\u0026rsquo;s and low low\u0026rsquo;s. Bike touring brings with it great freedom and elation, but also at times complete and utter despair.\n I had never slept in such an eclectic mix of places: in farmers\u0026rsquo; fields, church basements, next to a haybale, under hula hoops in a school gym, in strangers\u0026rsquo; backyards, next to a Playskool kitchen\u0026hellip;\n I had never been labelled a \u0026ldquo;hippie\u0026rdquo;. I had never met 18 other people on one day and then built a community and family with them by the next week.\n\n\nI was exposed to a lot of new things, many of which I am still digesting. And as I sit pondering my past and looming adventures, it dawns on me that doing a PhD and going on an Otesha tour are not so different:\nLike my Otesha experience, my PhD will centre on educating youth, promoting critical thinking, and questioning assumptions.Like on tour, I will need endurance to make it through all the checkpoints. Some legs of the journey will be enjoyable and I will feel like I am flying, but others will test my strength and I will feel like I have been hauling a trailer for 100+km.\nLike on tour, I will be living my passion!\nI may or may not find myself sleeping beside Playskool kitchens\u0026hellip;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ll be labelled a \u0026ldquo;hippie\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;m quite sure I will be labelled an \u0026ldquo;academic\u0026rdquo;. Interestingly, the two share (in my opinion) a reluctance to part with ideals and a naive refusal to join the real world.Like my Otesha family, I hope to meet a community of like-minded people who I can connect with and draw on for ideas and support.\nLiving on your bike for two months will teach you some important lessons. These I want to carry with me through life and through the next PhD years:\n1. There will be hills.\nThere will be hills, you will have to work to get to the top, and it will be hard. When you get there you might be faced with yet another hill, this one steeper. But the saving grace is that you can always look to your bike buddy to divide the pain, if not the work.\n2. Every spoke plays its part.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about wheels and spokes is that a wheel really needs all of its spokes to work. If one spoke is slack, the strength of the wheel is compromised. If one is overly tense, it is taking on too much and will eventually break. So I ask myself how I can be the best spoke I can be\u0026hellip;\n3. Once in a while, remember how big the universe is.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing like cycling through Ontario\u0026rsquo;s rolling hills, cornfield after cornfield, to remind you how small you are and how big the universe is. And there\u0026rsquo;s nothing like wrapping your mind around the size of the universe that will inspire an appreciation for mystery. And there\u0026rsquo;s nothing like realizing you are in the middle of a grand mystery to dispel the small problems of the everyday. So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if mosquitoes are taking over your tent or unread papers your desk. I do what I do for those moments of indescribable connection to the earth.\n\nSo with brain refreshed, heart refilled, and pedalling legs strong, I look forward to my PhD.\n","date":1282246140,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1282246140,"objectID":"2b2b4f563491b5d9863f8807d316d4fc","permalink":"/post/bike-lessons/","publishdate":"2010-08-19T19:29:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bike-lessons/","section":"post","summary":"I am Ingrid, a returning member of the Cottenie lab.

We are less often exposed to the third type of cause, implicit differences between scientists, or the inherent subjectivity to science, if you will.After reading the\u0026nbsp;primer by O.J. Schmitz\u0026nbsp;to an very interesting article by Pringle et al., both in PLoS Biology, I was again made aware of the importance of subjectivity in reading articles. The function of the primer is to provide a bigger context to an article such that it becomes more accessible to a bigger audience. \u0026nbsp;In his primer, Schmitz argues that there are two views on spatial dynamics in empirical systems: an intuitive and well-studied meta-system (or meta-community) view, and a self-organized system view that received less attention because it is a more abstract construct.While you could argue at\u0026nbsp;nauseam\u0026nbsp;which is the most abstract theory, and whether self-emergent systems are uniquely characterized by positive interactions within a patch and negative feedback between patches, I interpreted the original article quite differently from Schmitz. I agree that the establishment of termite mounts is potentially an example of a self-organized system, but this is not the focus of the article. The focus of the article is what consequences these termite mounts have on the ecosystem. And at this point, the more natural theoretical framework is a metacommunity framework. Once the termite mounts are established, they become similar to lakes in a landscape, with very distinct environmental conditions within the mounts versus the savannah matrix. These differences in environmental conditions, together with dispersal dynamics, result in specific arthropod, plant, and arboreal predator communities. And this is exactly the metacommunity, or meta-ecosystem, approach.So based on my interpretation, this article is not so much about self-organized systems as it provides a nice example of species sorting dynamics in a metacommunity expressed at multiple trophic levels. But am I maybe biased because I think that ecology is actually metacommunity ecology?

Intuition is a very powerful (human?) tool. We all know this (all my better ideas arrive to me magically on my bike ride home), and research actually shows this (see the articles references by;Ap Dijksterhuis, e.g, his 2006 Science article). We seem to be hardwired to find solutions to problems, even (and sometimes especially) without thinking about them. However, we should always check whether our intuition is correct, with new data, in whatever form it comes: observations, models, experiments, etc. The\u0026nbsp;scientific method\u0026nbsp;is nothing else than a formalization of this process: the hypothesis and prediction are a formal representation of your intuition on what causes a certain problem or question, and all the tests are formal ways to obtain new data. I think this explains partly the power of the scientific method as a way of explaining phenomena: it is actually a very natural way to approach a problem.The article by Doug Saunders implicitly uses this method, by starting the article and each subsection with the intuitive notion of the common consensus on how the world would progress, and it follows this by the actual data 10 years later. The very short version of his analysis: if you look at socio-economical benchmarks, the world improved substantially in the last 10 years. Surprisingly, I also think that the main point that D. Saunders failed to cover, and it is a huge one, is the deteriorating environment in the last 10 years. I think that all the indicators would show a decline in the environment (anybody has any references for this statement?).So the main question for the next 10 years is whether these socio-political improvements are going to be sustainable.

However, sometimes you get struck by lightening, by an experience that makes you wonder, \u0026ldquo;How did I ever function without this?\u0026rdquo;. 3 years ago, I was introduced to concept mapping by Steve Crawford, but I am not exactly sure how we got on this subject. Probably one of those serendipitous moments in life, instigated by being on the same floor and bumping into each other (location, location, location). Steve even has a whole room set up to use concept mapping for his research (yes, I am only a little bit jealous).\nI used it for the first, haphazardly I have to admit, in Fall 2008 for Biology of Polluted Waters. I did give students to choice between either creating concepts using pen and paper, or computer software, and they only had to use it for the semester-long assignment. This was a mixed success, because I forgot rule number 1 when teaching: start small, and practice. I added more information on concept mapping in Winter 2009 for Community Ecology, but only really committed in the Summer and Fall of 2009, with providing guidelines on how to use and construct concept maps, specific exercises, grading rubrics (bad ones, updated them since), moving focus away from writing to concept maps, including them in all part of the learning experience.\nIt is such an important tool that I also force all my grad students (and I try this with all my collaborators as well), to construct a concept map before sending me any written text. If they do send me a written text first, I often have to quickly create a concept map before I can read the text again, and I send them the concept map first before rewriting the text. That is why concept mapping earns a separate commandment in The Cottenie Commandments.\nSo I do think they are an important tool for learners. There are probably a lot of reasons for this, but I want to point out 2.\nFirstly, it is a very intuitive way of presenting and working with information. The example I use in one of my classes is this diagram by Richard Scarry (I got this idea from the book \u0026ldquo;Advanced Presentations by Design, from Andrew Abela\u0026rdquo;, highly recommended):\n\nSecond, it provides a very efficient way of taking information and working with it to come up with the intuitive presentation. One of the best examples to illustrate this transformation of complexity to a structured, logical, intuitive representation of information is by somebody who makes his living doing this (and I can use another TED talk again). Why do I like this example so much: almost everybody has a credit card, but hardly anybody reads the agreement (at least I do not) because of the complexity of the language and the document. But reading the one pager that has all the necessary information, waw.\u0026nbsp;\nAs you can see, these 2 examples are not your regular examples of concept maps. Why did I take these two examples? Because they also illustrate that concept maps and concept mapping should never be the goal or the objective, which is ultimately about information presentation. I am convinced, though, that they were an important tool, either explicitly or implicitly, in creating these two presentations. Do I have proof of this? No, but we are working on a study that will test the potential relationship between concept mapping and critical thinking.\n","date":1278934680,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1278934680,"objectID":"422bb5ce9620796f28d96435b6816eca","permalink":"/post/concept-maps-the-tool-for-learners/","publishdate":"2010-07-12T11:38:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/concept-maps-the-tool-for-learners/","section":"post","summary":"Learning (be it as a scientist, a teacher, a student, or any combination of the above, this will be the topic of another blog) is a difficult process, as any scientist, teacher, or student will tell you.

My name is Kyle and I am a recent addition to the Cottenie Lab. I will be undertaking an undergraduate research project under the guidance of Karl and the rest of the gang at CottenieLab beginning this fall (you may have seen my mug in a recent post on this blog in daphnia/stormtrooper attire!). First, a little bit about me\u0026hellip; my passions include diving, the outdoors and marine science (not necessarily in that order) and I have been fascinated with aquatic systems since spending my childhood summers sifting through tide pools on Canada’s east coast. Since arriving in Guelph back in 2006, I’ve spent my fair share of time wading in swamps and falling into streams in South-western Ontario, however in recent years I have managed to finagle a few research positions on the West coast. My work with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Pacific Fisheries Resource and Conservation Council in 2008\u0026frasl;09, centred on pacific salmon populations in the Canadian Western Arctic. Working at the Pacific Biological Station in British Columbia allowed me the opportunity to explore, analyse and write on fisheries records dating back to the mid 19th century (synopsis: a species of pacific salmon not usually known to migrate very far up-river to spawn has been found to not only migrate over 2000 km up the Mackenzie and Liard rivers (to here), but has also found a way to survive in water that is considered to be colder than their lower tolerance level. It is likely that these fish were separated from their southern, pacific kin during the last ice age, ~10 000 years ago).\nSince early 2009 I have had the good fortune to work on various ecological monitoring initiatives with Parks Canada at Gulf Islands National Park Reserve (GINPR) in South-western British Columbia. At GINPR, our various monitoring projects are designed to take the “pulse” of the park. Whether it be hiding in the bushes at the crack of dawn, recording equipment in hand, ready to “spy” on songbirds, or count clams buried in the sand, or count deer turds, the goal at the end of the day is to make sure that the ecological health of the park is being maintained. Which brings me to my undergraduate project\u0026hellip; Using a data set collected over the past 7 years in the park, I will be performing an analysis on food web dynamics and attempting to determine the influence of various biotic and abiotic factors in Southern Gulf Island eelgrass beds.\nMy office\nBut Kyle, what does that have to do with zooplankton metacommunity structure, diversity and dynamics? I’m glad you asked. While fish community trophic structure may initially seem like a far cry from zooplankton community dynamics, many of the underlying ecological mechanisms are very similar. For example, the influence of the outflow of the Fraser River into the southern gulf of Georgia creates both a salinity and nutrient gradient across the islands (look Karl! Spatial heterogeneity!). This gradient, along with other abiotic factors such as PDO and El Nino/La Nina cycles creates a complex array of conditions which may influence species composition, trophic dynamics, and species dispersal in the eelgrass beds. What kinds of controls (i.e. top down or bottom up?) are acting on the system and how can that information be translated into ecosystem management decisions? As I explore these questions I hope to broaden my knowledge of both theoretical and practical ecology as well as strengthen my statistical abilities.\nWith the aid of a ROV we discover a large bed of sea pens, a type of octocoral. Photo taken aboard the Pacific Legacy, off of Sidney Island, BC.\nBeing exposed to such a wide array of monitoring projects, I am struck by how interconnected the various communities are, and I often get a shiver down my spine when I think of the glut of unanswered research questions that are pertinent to ecology in the park.\nSending the ROV down to investigate the drop-off at Dock Islet. We find a rather sassy Lingcod and a Copper Rockfish\nI invite you to join me for the next few months as I tackle anything and everything eelgrass! Tune in next time as I discuss ecosystem management, shifting baselines, and the trials and tribulations of learning “R”. But until then, I will be away on Pender and Saturna Islands counting birds and then it will be off to the interior of BC for a bit.

It was a well organized conference with a lot of energy and some very interesting talks and posters. Quebec City served as a wonderful setting for the conference and I was impressed by how the conference was truly bilingual. I was also impressed by vieux Quebec and the beauty of the St.Lawrence.\nThis was my first \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; conference and hence my first \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; presentation. I was eager (and a little nervous) to present my MSc research thus far. My presentation was entitled \u0026ldquo;Zooplankton metacommunity responses to climate change in the subarctic\u0026rdquo; (A.Winegardner and K. Cottenie) and was presented in the Conservation and Climate Change session. The main take home messages for this presentation (and really our work on this project thus far) are:\n- salinity of coastal freshwater systems along the coast of Hudson Bay is increasing.\n- this increase may exceed tolerated limits of salinity in many zooplankton species.\n- salt addition during a field experiment did not have the expected effect of changing zooplankton community composition in either isolated or potentially connected rock pools.\n- salinity may not be the most important environmental driver in this metacommunity. Rather pool hydroperiod, connectivty and resting egg dynamics may be important either alone or in concert.\n- this study is one of the first to apply the metacommunity concept to an issue of climate change.\nStudents and faculty from the Integrative Biology department and School of Environmental Science at Guelph contributed about 10-12 presentations and posters at this conference. This along with the sheer number of student presentations made for a very supportive environment. My talk was not the only from Guelph with a Churchill focus. Nick and Ola from the Gregory Lab presented their research on genome size of Churchill area and low arctic crustaceans and molluscs respectively. Once I got my talk out of the way I was able to attend many interesting presentations. I was especially intrigued by several presentations on metacommunity dynamics, connectivity, network theory and fragmentation by students and post-docs from the Gonzalez lab at McGill University.\nThe conference also included a student workshop on science communication and the media. Jim Handman, executive producer of the CBC radio show \u0026ldquo;Quirks and Quarks\u0026rdquo; spoke about how the media often interprets the majority of science as falling into 1 of 3 categories:\n- an oddity (think wierd science)\n- a threat (ex. honeybee Colony Collpase Disorder, nuclear weapons, big pharma)\n- a cure (every newspaper wants to be the one to run the headline \u0026ldquo;Scientist cures cancer\u0026rdquo;)\nBut the problem with this is science is not black and white or neatly categorized like this. And the headline \u0026ldquo;Scientist cures cancer\u0026rdquo; is probably more accurately read as (example from Handman) \u0026ldquo;Scientists and numerous collaborators, graduate students and undergraduate summer students find some statistically significant evidence that treatment X results in marginally reduced levels of Y in subpopulation A when all other variables are controlled.\u0026rdquo; This reminded me that uncertainty is one of the exciting things about science and that even though I haven\u0026rsquo;t sorted out what all my experimental results mean yet, there are tons of possible explanations out there.\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to future conferences and especially to the CSEE\u0026rsquo;s 2011 conference which will be held in Banff.\n","date":1273768020,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1273768020,"objectID":"29c8b63e05953ff7abdfa695b7ddf50e","permalink":"/post/the-world-of-conferences/","publishdate":"2010-05-13T16:27:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-world-of-conferences/","section":"post","summary":"I also had the opportunity to attend a conference this week, the 5th annual meeting of the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution, held at the Universite Laval.

Spatial and temporal connectivity were classified into four connectivity classes to evaluate the interaction between aquatic connectivity and fish assemblage structure.

In addition, these tests need to be continuously updated. Cottenie (2005) linked observed metacommunities to theoretical models based on whether environmental and/or spatial effects in the observed metacommunity significantly explain community structure. However, a species-sorting metacommunity with high dispersal and one with limited dispersal cannot be distinguished in this manner; both produce significant environmental and spatial effects. In the present study, we demonstrate a solution to this problem using a zooplankton rock pool metacommunity in Churchill, Manitoba, sampled in August 2006. We established a hierarchy of metacommunities in the Churchill rock bluff system—a large, across-bluff metacommunity, and small, within-bluff metacommunities. Using this spatial hierarchy, it is possible to determine the zooplankton dispersal capability in the rock bluff system and hence to link the metacommunity to its corresponding model. We found the zooplankton rock bluff system to exhibit limited dispersal, meaning that spatial effects were significant at the across-bluff scale, but depending on the bluff, were significant or insignificant at the within-bluff scale. Environmental effects were significant at both scales. This study demonstrates a novel way to determine dispersal capabilities in species that are cryptic dispersers, and to successfully link observed metacommunities with theoretical models.","tags":["Dispersal","Metacommunity","Rock pools","Spatial scales","Sub-arctic","Zooplankton"],"title":"Hierarchical zooplankton metacommunities: distinguishing between high and limiting dispersal mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan B.

Despite its importance, little is known about its role in freshwater habitats and its relation to habitat type (lentic vs. lotic), especially for organisms with cryptic dispersal methods such as plankton. Poor dispersers are expected to show more clumped distributions or greater spatial autocorrelation (SA) in community composition than good dispersers. We examined patterns of SA across freshwater taxa with different dispersal modes (active vs. passive) and their association with habitat type (lake vs. stream) using 18 spatially explicit community composition data sets. We found significant relationships between SA and body size among taxa in lake habitats, but not in streams. However, the increase in SA with body size in lakes was driven entirely by fishes—organisms ranging in size from diatoms to macro-invertebrates showed equivalent levels of SA. These results support the idea that large organisms are less effective dispersers in aquatic environments, resulting in greater SA in community structure over broad scales. Streams may be effectively more connected than lakes as patterns of SA and body size were weaker in lotic habitats. Our data suggest that the critical threshold where greater body size increases dispersal limitation seems to come at the juncture between invertebrates and vertebrates rather than that between unicellular and multicellular organisms as has been previously suggested.","tags":["Fish","Lakes versus streams","Macro-invertebrates","Meta-analysis","Plankton"],"title":"Spatial autocorrelation and dispersal limitation in freshwater organisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shubha N.

However, long-term field data for testing of available metacommunity models are still scarce, and the extent to which these models apply to the real world remains unknown. Tests conducted so far have largely sought to fit data on the entire regional set of species to one of several metacommunity models, implicitly assuming that all species operate similarly over the same set of sites. However, species differ in their habitat use. These differences can, in the most general terms, be expressed as a gradient of habitat specialization (ranging from habitat specialists to habitat generalists). We postulate that such differences in habitat specialization will have implications for metacommunity dynamics. Specifically, we predict that specialists respond more to local processes and generalists respond to regional spatial processes. We tested these predictions using natural microcosm communities for which long-term (nine-year) environmental and population dynamics data were available. We used redundancy analysis to determine the proportion of variation explained by environmental and spatial factors. We repeated this analysis to explain variation in the entire regional set of species, in generalist species only, and in specialists only. We further used ANOVA to test for differences in the proportions of explained variation. We found that habitat specialists responded primarily to environmental factors and habitat generalists responded mainly to spatial factors. Thus, from the metacommunity perspective, the dynamics of habitat specialists are best explained by a combination of species sorting and mass effects, while that of habitat generalists are best explained by patch dynamics and neutral models. Consequently, we infer that a natural metacommunity can exhibit complicated dynamics, with some groups of species (e.g., habitat specialists) governed according to environmental processes and other groups (e.g., habitat generalists) governed mainly by dispersal processes.","tags":["mass effects","patch dynamics","species sorting","neutral models","habitat generalists","habitat specialists","habitat specialization","Jamaica","metacommunity models","variance partitioning"],"title":"Contrasts between habitat generalists and specialists: an empirical extension to the basic metacommunity framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin A.

A major benefit of the mycorrhizal symbiosis is that it can protect plants from below-ground enemies, such as pathogens. Previous studies have indicated that plant identity (particularly plants that differ in root system architecture) or fungal identity (fungi from different families within the Glomeromycota) can determine the degree of protection from infection by pathogens. Here, we test the combined effects of plant and fungal identity to assess if there is a strong interaction between these two factors. 2. We paired one of two plants (Setaria glauca, a plant with a finely branched root system and Allium cepa, which has a simple root system) with one of six different fungal species from two families within the Glomeromycota. We assessed the degree to which plant identity, fungal identity and their interaction determined infection by Fusarium oxysporum, a common plant pathogen. 3. Our results show that the interaction between plant and fungal identity can be an important determinant of root infection by the pathogen. Infection by Fusarium was less severe in Allium (simple root system) or when Setaria (complex root system) was associated with a fungus from the family Glomeraceae. We also detected significant plant growth responses to the treatments; the fine-rooted Setaria benefited more from associating with a member of the family Glomeraceae, while Allium benefited more from associating with a member of the family Gigasporaceae. 4. Synthesis. This study supports previous claims that plants with complex root systems are more susceptible to infection by pathogens, and that the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis can reduce infection in such plants – provided that the plant is colonized by a mycorrhizal fungus that can offer protection, such as the isolates of Glomus used here.","tags":["arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi","Fusarium oxysporum","mycorrhizal function","mycorrhizal identity","pathogen protection","plant-soil interactions","root architecture"],"title":"Plant and fungal identity determines pathogen protection of plant roots by arbuscular mycorrhizas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Frank Vande Meutter","Karl Cottenie","Luc De Meester"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1228107600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1228107600,"objectID":"db5f3cf36b59939c38690dd93354436e","permalink":"/publication/vandemeutter-2008-fal/","publishdate":"2008-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vandemeutter-2008-fal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring differences in macroinvertebrate communities from emergent, floating-leaved and submersed vegetation in shallow ponds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Vanormelingen","Karl Cottenie","Erik Michels","Koenraad Muylaert","Wim Vyverman","Luc De Meester"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199163600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199163600,"objectID":"8613b2c43350f2994c3a46bf5c21e9ce","permalink":"/publication/vanormelingen-2008-fb/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/vanormelingen-2008-fb/","section":"publication","summary":"1. The recognition that both local and regional processes act together in shaping local communities makes determining their relative roles in natural communities central to understanding patterns in community structure. 2. We investigated the relative influence of these processes on the phytoplankton communities of a highly interconnected pond system. We sampled the phytoplankton communities of 28 ponds concurrently with 20 local environmental variables. 3. We found that phytoplankton community variation, in terms of both phytoplankton community composition (PCC) and diversity, was only significantly explained by local environmental variables. These were mainly associated with the contrasting clear-water and turbid ecological states of the shallow ponds studied. Clear-water conditions favoured only a few taxa, resulting in a significantly lower taxon diversity and richness under these conditions. 4. The failure to explain variation in PCC by a dispersal model based on the water flow between ponds points at very effective species sorting. This is attributed to the high population turn-over rates and sensitivity to environmental conditions of phytoplankton communities. Some evidence was found, however, that dispersal influences local communities through mass effects between neighbouring ponds. 5. Overall, our results emphasize both the strong selection pressure that components of the food web exert on phytoplankton communities and the high potential of these communities to respond to such environmental change, thereby effectively opposing the homogenizing effects of continuous dispersal.","tags":["metacommunity","dispersal","species sorting","phytoplankton","ponds"],"title":"The relative importance of dispersal and local processes in structuring phytoplankton communities in a set of highly interconnected ponds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Taking a metacommunity approach, spatial factors can become important either through dispersal limitation (compare large spatial scales) or mass effects (in case of strongly connected systems). We here analyze two datasets on bacterial communities [characterized by community fingerprinting through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)] in meso- to eutrophic shallow lakes to investigate the importance of spatial factors at three contrasting scales. Variation partitioning on datasets of both the bacterial communities of 11 shallow lakes that are part of a strongly interconnected and densely packed pond system textless1 km apart, three groups of shallow lakes ≈100 km apart, as well as these three groups of shallow lakes combined that span a large part of a North-South gradient in Europe (textgreater2,500 km) shows a strong impact of local environmental factors on bacterial community composition, with a marginal impact of spatial distance. Our results indicate that dispersal is not strongly limiting even at large spatial scales, and that mass effects do not have a strong impact on bacterial communities even in physically connected systems. We suggest that the fast population growth rates of bacteria facilitate efficient species sorting along environmental gradients in bacterial communities over a very broad range of dispersal rates.","tags":["mass effects","dispersal limitation","metacommunity biology","microbial biogeography","microbial community"],"title":"The power of species sorting: Local factors drive bacterial community composition over a wide range of spatial scales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The same issue arises at the community level; are population sizes driven primarily by changes in the abundances of cooccurring competitors (i.e., compensatory dynamics), or do most species have a common response to environmental factors? Competitive interactions have had a central place in ecological theory, dating back to Gleason, Volterra, Hutchison and MacArthur, and, more recently, Hubbell's influential unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. If competitive interactions are important in driving year-to-year fluctuations in abundance, then changes in the abundance of one species should generally be accompanied by compensatory changes in the abundances of others. Thus, one necessary consequence of strong compensatory forces is that, on average, species within communities will covary negatively. Here we use measures of community covariance to assess the prevalence of negative covariance in 41 natural communities comprising different taxa at a range of spatial scales. We found that species in natural communities tended to covary positively rather than negatively, the opposite of what would be expected if compensatory dynamics were important. These findings suggest that abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation are more important than competitive interactions in driving year-to-year fluctuations in species abundance within communities.","tags":["biological interactions","community dynamics","negative covariance","neutral models","zero-sum"],"title":"Compensatory dynamics are rare in natural ecological communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin S.

Few studies have been able to evaluate the consequences of climate variables on the structure and dynamics of biological communities, in large part because the lack of data at appropriate spatial and temporal scales has made it difficult to adequately address local-scale responses of species and communities to such events over relevant time scales. Here, we combined an unprecedented dataset of kelp forest species' abundances from the Channel Islands, California with data for several local, regional, and global scale climatic variables to evaluate the temporal and spatial scale at which one can detect community-wide effects of climate variables, in particular ENSO events. We found large and significant local-scale differences in community structure, but these differences were not related to differences in climatic variables. Moreover, giant kelp abundance, which has been shown to be highly sensitive to water temperature and storm disturbance, was a poor predictor of community differences, and all communities tended to decline in abundance over the 20-year sampling period, suggesting a press perturbation to the system such as PDO cycles or sustained fishing pressure. Although ENSO events can have dramatic impacts on the abundance and distribution of giant kelp itself across the range of the species, such events appear to have little effect on local-scale kelp forest community structure or dynamics.","tags":["community structure","California","Channel Islands","El Niño","kelp forests","long-term monitoring","Macrocystis pyrifera","spatial and temporal shifts"],"title":"Little evidence for climate effects on local-scale structure and dynamics of California kelp forest communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm is used to classify species of freshwater crustacean zooplankton as geographically informative or geographically non-informative. Geographically non-informative species tend to have a broad distribution, while geographically informative species exhibit a locality that suggests a greater degree of ecological vulnerability. The data under analysis were mined from the literature from 1930 to 1992 and are in the form of presence/absence data for each species. An evolutionary algorithm is used to maximize the correlation of the geographic distances between ponds with the Hamming distances between ponds computed from the species presence/absence data. Maximization is over the set of species selected for computation of the Hamming distance. The representation used is a binary-gene evolutionary algorithm that selects which species are used. The evolutionary algorithm has highly consistent results between runs. All the runs select the same large group (meaning those species are geographically informative) and fail to select from another large group (meaning those are geographically non-informative); a small number of species are ambiguous, sometimes selected and sometimes not. A second set of experiments in which a large number of short runs are made demonstrates that the fitness landscape of the optimization problem in this study is not a single multi-dimensional hill. Non-trivial interaction between different loci in the representation is found.

[1230][1]), B. S. Halpern et al. conclude that these forests show strong top-down (consumer-driven) control and that bottom-up (resource-driven) control in such systems may often be overestimated.  These conclusions run counter to most of the extensive literature ([1][2]–[4][3]) on the ecology and natural history of kelp forests in southern California. There are numerous examples of the importance of storms and low nutrients over large spatial and temporal scales, especially during El Niños ([3][4], [5][5]–[7][6]) but also from decadal climate shifts ([8][7]). Halpern et al. used a short-term data set that did not include El Niño-Southern Oscillation or decadal climate shifts. Moreover, they used satellite-derived offshore chlorophyll a concentration data as a measure of “resources” without establishing that these data were a good proxy for nutrients or primary production in nearshore kelp forests and despite evidence to the contrary [e.g., ([9][8], [10][9])].  The primary evidence for top-down effects was correlations interpreted by Halpern et al. as showing that spiny lobsters and Kellet's whelks were “significantly important species, likely due to their strong impacts on key grazers of kelp (urchins) and algae (limpets and snails).” There is indirect evidence that lobsters may affect urchins ([11][10], [12][11]), but Kellet's whelk is primarily a scavenger ([13][12]) whose abundance has been negatively correlated with kelp forests ([14][13]). Neither animal has been shown to have “strong” impacts on their prey species in California kelp forests. Halpern et al. could think of no mechanism by which the two other significant species “control” algae. The diets of these fish indicate no such mechanism; the correlations likely result from habitat preferences ([15][14]). The lack of significant correlation between kelp and urchins is counter to their hypothesis but was not discussed. The analytical results may be generally misleading due to weak trophic links [e.g., many of the grazers eat other algae in addition to kelp, and commonly eat drift, not attached plants ([3][4])]. Thus, neither bottom-up nor top-down effects were tested and the conclusions, therefore, are unsubstantiated.  1.  1.[↵][15] 1.   W. J. North  , Nova Hedwigia 32, 1 (1971).

Halpern et al. conclude that top-down (predatory) effects are strong and more important than bottom-up (nutrient) effects in setting kelp forest community structure. They reach this conclusion through a statistical technique that examines mathematical associations among variables. Like any statistical technique that tests for correlations, it is unable to assign causality or deal effectively with highly correlated explanatory variables (“multicolinearity”). By including several highly intercorrelated predictor variables in their statistical model, it is essentially impossible to estimate bottom-up effects ([1][54], [2][55]). For example, because nutrient concentrations are tightly correlated with water temperature in southern California ([3][56]), it is probably impossible to separate temperature from bottom-up effects. Furthermore, their exclusion of sites from the warmest and most nutrient-poor waters ([4][57]) limits the ability to detect bottom-up effects.  Statistical associations between predator abundance and aspects of community structure lead Halpern and colleagues to conclude that predators drive community structure, but they offer few plausible mechanisms. A more likely causal link, bottom-up effects driving kelp forest community structure (including predator abundance) ([5][58]–[7][59]), would produce identical statistical results. For example, the predatory kelp rockfish was identified as exerting significant “top-down control,” but this fish is found almost exclusively with kelp because it is dependent on it, not vice versa ([7][59]).  Finally, the purported top-down effects are weak, explaining at most 20% of the variation in community structure. Other variables (e.g., water temperature and geographic location) explained 2 to 27 times more of the variation in community structure for all trophic levels but kelps ([4][57]). Modern statistical tests give us unprecedented ability to discover patterns in complex data sets, but such patterns can only be interpreted when combined with a sound understanding of the natural history of the system.  1.  1.[↵][60] 1.

[OpenUrl][74]  # Response #article-title-3  Foster et al. and Steele et al. raise a number of concerns about our recent study. An important aspect of our analyses is that our dependent variables were species abundances, not the aggregate trophic values that are traditionally used. Our approach enhances the possibility of detecting either bottom-up or top-down patterns for individual or groups of species because assumptions about the nature (direct or indirect) of the relationships between species and trophic levels are unnecessary, and because it can detect compensatory dynamics within a trophic level that could eliminate aggregate top-down or bottom-up effects. Foster et al. 's concern about the species highlighted by our analyses likely arises from their expectation that direct trophic links must exist for the results to be valid. We were not assessing whether a “trophic cascade” existed, but instead evaluating the direction of control within communities. Indeed, our results may not have emerged from traditional approaches, and they highlight the potential importance of indirect effects in controlling community structure.  Both Letters express concern that we suggest cause and effect through correlations and not experiments. Despite reliance on correlational relationships, large-scale studies like ours have a long record of providing new insight through analysis over spatial and temporal scales beyond the reach and budget of experimental study. We focused on the hypothesized mechanisms that would be responsible for either bottom-up or top-down control—nutrient availability and predator abundance—and then determined the amount of variation explained by these two different groups of variables for algal and mid-trophic level abundances. The expected cause and effect are certainly implicit in our study, but will require significant resources before they can be tested experimentally.  Steele et al. are correct in noting that multicolinearity can create problems ([1][75]). However, our principal objective was to construct the best predictive model for both top-down and bottom-up variables, a situation in which “multicolinearity can be effectively ignored” [([1][75]), p. 2811]. Nevertheless, we limited multicolinearity problems within each different predictor group by eliminating highly multicolinear variables, an approach ([1][75]) that acts to conservatively decrease significant results (top-down control, in our case). Furthermore, we reported “pure” top-down and bottom-up effects in table S2 and Fig. 3, which are the amounts of explained variation after eliminating the multicolinearities between the different predictor groups. Contrary to Steele et al. 's expectations, top-down and spatial or temperature variables were colinear while bottom-up and temperature variables were not (see [table][76]), such that adding multicolinearity to our results would have suggested even stronger top-down effects.  View this table:  In addition, the results from our cited companion paper ([2][77]) show that the combination of wave disturbance and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) explains only 6% of the variance, and in situ temperature explains less than 1% of the variance in kelp forest community structure based on 18 years of data spanning several strong and weak ENSO events. As we noted (see SOM), the use of satellite-derived productivity data in coastal waters has been extensively validated in our study region [(see also ([3][78])]. Importantly, the variation in primary production ([4][79]) is sufficient to detect potential bottom-up effects, despite missing the extreme nutrient limitation encountered at the southern limit of M. pyrifera .  Other variables such as geographic location are, indeed, at least as important as the top-down variables we identified ([2][77]). However, explaining 20% of variation in community structure is a notable result ([5][80]), and these “other” variables are largely outside the human influence and so less useful for management purposes.  The claim that our results run counter to the literature on kelp forest ecology is untrue [see, for example, ([6][81]–[9][82])], and we disagree with the suggestion that bottom-up effects offer a more parsimonious explanation of our results. Also, the referenced bottom-up associations are not tests of nutrient versus predator effects on entire kelp forest communities and counter examples exist, as with the monitoring of extreme eutrophication of kelp forests off San Diego that found no effect on kelp forest communities ([10][83]). Consequently, compensatory mechanisms among species are likely more important than a simple trophic cascade framework would suggest, with these effects driven by top-down forces. Our novel approach allowed us to uncover these results and to open up the quest for the mechanisms driving them.  1.  1.[↵][84] 1.   M. H. Graham  , Ecology 84, 2809 (2003).

Yet recent large-scale studies of community regulation in marine ecosystems have shown dramatically different results that leave this issue largely unresolved. We combined a multiyear, large-scale data set of species abundances for 46 species in kelp forests from the California Channel Islands with satellite-derived primary production and found that top-down control explains 7- to 10-fold more of the variance in abundance of bottom and mid-trophic levels than does bottom-up control. This top-down control was propagated via a variety of species-level direct and indirect responses to predator abundance. Management of top-down influences such as fishing may be more important in coastal marine ecosystems, particularly in kelp forest systems, than is commonly thought. The community structure and biomass of California kelp forests are largely controlled by top-down factors such as predatory fish, rather than by levels of dissolved nutrients.

In these metacommunities, the relative importance of local environmental and regional spatial processes is currently hotly debated, especially in terms of the validity of neutral model. I collected 158 published data sets with information on community structure, environmental and spatial variables. I showed that approximately 50% of the variation in community composition is explained by both environmental and spatial variables. The majority of the data sets were structured by species-sorting dynamics (SS), followed by a combination of SS and mass-effect dynamics. While neutral processes were the only structuring process in 8% of the collected natural communities, disregarding neutral dispersal processes would result in missing important patterns in 37% of the studied communities. Moreover, metacommunity characteristics such as dispersal type, habitat type and spatial scale predicted part of the detected variation in metacommunity structure.","tags":["dispersal","Body size","environmental heterogeneity","mass effects","meta-analysis","metacommunity theory","neutral theory","patch dynamics","species sorting","variation decomposition"],"title":"Integrating environmental and spatial processes in ecological community dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karl Cottenie","Luc De Meester"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072933200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072933200,"objectID":"2df515026e2a66ef0656530e3c7b0ade","permalink":"/publication/cottenie-2004-e/","publishdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cottenie-2004-e/","section":"publication","summary":"The relative importance of regional and local processes in determining community structure is a long-standing problem in community ecology. This is especially problematic in communities from highly connected habitats, which undergo two opposing forces: differences in environmental conditions of the habitats lead to divergence of the communities, while the dispersal of individuals leads to convergence of the communities. Using a transplant experiment, we experimentally showed that biotic interactions have a predictable, deterministic impact on zooplankton community structure in a metacommunity of highly interconnected shallow ponds. Fish predation and presence of abundant macrophyte cover rapidly structured regional communities of zooplankton, both in terms of relative abundances and of cladoceran species richness. Moreover, we could use the relations between the experimentally manipulated environmental conditions and the observed experimental communities to successfully classify the contrasting local communities found in the original neighboring ponds, thus directly relating the experimental results to the actual field situation. Notwithstanding the observed strong impact of local biotic conditions, we also showed that dispersal had an influence on community structure and species richness. Dispersal increased species richness of cladocerans by three species and influenced zooplankton community structure. Moreover, dispersal actually made the response to local conditions more deterministic.","tags":["metacommunity","alternative equilibria","community structure","fish predation","zooplankton","shallow lakes","species richness","dispersal","enclosure","local vs. regional processes","macrophyte cover","transplant experiment"],"title":"Metacommunity Structure: Synergy of Biotic Interactions as Selective Agents and Dispersal as Fuel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

The shallow ponds of the nature reserve ‘De Maten’ form a metacommunity, in which individual ponds are highly interconnected via a system of overflows and rivulets. This study reports on the relations between cladoceran species richness and (a) connectivity patterns and (b) local environmental variables. 2. No relation was found between local species richness and three connectivity variables or dispersal pathways. 3. Spatial configuration was related to richness, but was confounded by environmental variables for 2 of 3 years. In those 2 years, there was a significant linear relation between Secchi disc depth and species richness, suggesting an important impact of the clearwater/turbid state alternative equilibria in shallow lakes in determining cladoceran richness. Only in the year in which environmental variables were unimportant did connectivity between the ponds influence species richness. 4. These results suggest that local environmental variables related to the clearwater/turbid state alternative equilibria in shallow lakes are important in determining cladoceran species richness. Connectivity and dispersal of individuals between the different ponds only act secondarily by increasing the general species richness within a pond through dispersal from ponds with different environmental conditions.","tags":["metacommunity","cladocera","connectivity","shallow lakes","species richness"],"title":"Connectivity and cladoceran species richness in a metacommunity of shallow lakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karl Cottenie","Erik Michels","Nele Nuytten","Luc De Meester"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041397200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041397200,"objectID":"e95f3070a5d7a01f84cac3f087c9b9b8","permalink":"/publication/cottenie-2003-e/","publishdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cottenie-2003-e/","section":"publication","summary":"Local communities can be structured by both local interactions (competition, predation, environmental variables, etc.) and by regional interactions (dispersal of individuals between habitats). Using data from a three-year study on 34 neighboring ponds in an interconnected pond system, we tested whether zooplankton communities show a metacommunity structure, how much variation in zooplankton community structure is related to local environmental factors vs. spatial configuration (taking into account the dispersal pathways), and what environmental variables are the locally structuring forces. In three different years, we found evidence for a metacommunity structure. We also found that spatial and environmental components act independently of each other due to the small geographic area and the high dispersal rates in this system. Despite these homogenizing forces, local environmental variables (associated with alternative equilibria in shallow lakes) were strongly related with zooplankton community structure in the studied years. This suggests that, even in this system of highly interconnected ponds, local environmental constraints can be strong enough to structure local communities. Corresponding Editor: P.

As the ponds share the same water source, geology and history, and as the ponds are interconnected (reducing chance effects of dispersal with colonisation), differences in zooplankton community structure can be attributed to local biotic and abiotic interactions. We studied zooplankton community, biotic (phytoplankton, macrophyte cover, fish densities, macroinvertebrate densities), abiotic (turbidity, nutrient concentrations, pH, conductivity, iron concentration) and morphometric (depth, area, perimeter) characteristics of the different ponds. Our results indicate that the ponds differ substantially in their zooplankton community structure, and that these differences are strongly related to differences in trophic structure and biotic interactions, in concordance with the theory of alternative equilibria. Ponds in the clear-water state are characterised by large Daphnia species and species associated with the littoral zone, low chlorophyll-a concentrations, low fish densities and high macroinvertebrate densities. Ponds in the turbid-water state are characterised by high abundances of rotifers, cyclopoid copepods and the opposite environmental conditions. Some ponds show an intermediate pattern, with a dominance of small Daphnia species. Our results show that interconnected ponds may differ strongly in zooplankton community composition, and that these differences are related to differences in predation intensity (top-down) and habitat diversity (macrophyte cover).","tags":["alternative equilibria","community structure","fish predation","macrophytes","shallow ponds","zooplankton"],"title":"Zooplankton community structure and environmental conditions in a set of interconnected ponds","type":"publication"}]
