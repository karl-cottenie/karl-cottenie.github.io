      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All IB graduate students should have received an email announcing the new batch of programs offered by the university to help graduate students with one of the most difficult academic skills: writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dear Graduate Faculty, Coordinators, and Graduate students,  Our analytics indicate that those students who receive writing instruction and consultation early in their graduate programs complete their degree requirements sooner. Our programs are designed for graduate student writers at all levels and stages.   Individual Writing Consultations: (starts January 15).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The claims made at the start of the email (&amp;ldquo;Our analytics indicate [&amp;hellip;] complete their degree requirements sooner.&amp;ldquo;) are contrary to a recent publication that received some exposure: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/37/9854&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences&amp;rdquo; by Feldon et al. 2017.&lt;/a&gt; The title already give the results away, but here is the main conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here we show that participation in such programs is not associated with detectable benefits related to skill development, socialization into the academic community, or scholarly productivity for students in our sample.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This study was no slouch, with 295 participating students, followed for several years with performances evaluated using standard rubrics, etc, and thus the pushback has been struggling with the quality of the study. For instance, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html&#34;&gt;Software Carpentry organization&lt;/a&gt;, whose reason for existence is offering these workshops, responded to this almost existential threat in quite some detail. While I think I perceived an undertone of defensiveness in their response, I think that the easiest explanation for these null effects are identified by the Software Carpentry people:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Benefits of a short course are easily lost in a sea of positive outcomes resulting from graduate training, but that has little bearing on the impact such courses may have when they stand alone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But that is of course also a sort of cop out. Although given that &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; 16% of the participants participated in such a workshop, the lack of detecting the influence of a single workshop in the wide range of personal outcomes is not that surprising. This is one of the cases where a post-hoc power analysis might have been informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second, standard, scientific cop out is that the authors did not measure the correct outcome. The end point identified by the original notification email (time to completion) was very different from the the endpoints measured in the long-term study (productivity, academic skills development, socialization into the academic community). However, in the appendix of the PNAS article, there is a variable &amp;ldquo;Time to Degree (T2)&amp;rdquo; that is not significant. It would be interesting to take a closer look at the Guelph data in that respective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the effectiveness of these workshops at a global level is not exactly clear, I think that it is clear that, from a graduate student perspective, you have to start somewhere. You will not immediately become the best writer in your cohort because you took a 2-day writing tune-up workshop, but you will become a better writer compared to the old you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Significance versus explanation</title>
      <link>/post/significance-versus-explanation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/significance-versus-explanation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next time I have to teach the difference between explanation and significance, this will be my go-to example: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0442-x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scientific aptitude better explains poor responses to teaching of evolution than psychological conflicts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Mead et al. in Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article has several figures that look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u3GC9EEJDcA/Wlz0mwsnJ-I/AAAAAAADCMw/QDTkJoUdUhY8i3CS7ZCncrxcttjT2mu7ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-01-15%2Bat%2B1.35.19%2BPM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; data-original-height=&#34;402&#34; data-original-width=&#34;373&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u3GC9EEJDcA/Wlz0mwsnJ-I/AAAAAAADCMw/QDTkJoUdUhY8i3CS7ZCncrxcttjT2mu7ACLcBGAs/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-01-15%2Bat%2B1.35.19%2BPM.png&#34; width=&#34;370&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The P-value looks amazing (9 x 10^-15), but the spread is equally large. I would not even want to guess what the R-square of that relationship is. The authors in the figure legend also specify that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The regression line is the best-fit line of y predicted by x. However, as assumptions of linear regression are not fully met it is provided for illustrative purposes alone to indicate the trend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Good point, because without that line it would be impossible to tell what the relationship would be, which is always a dire sign. But those two sentences should be part of a master class in scientific writing: Necessary, to the point, anticipating a reader&amp;rsquo;s needs and confusion, packaged in a short and succinct statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This study works perfectly well in a hypothetico-deductive framework with well-laid out hypotheses, logical predictions, and strong and convincing statistical tests. It also leaves the reader (or some of the readers, for instance me) with this &amp;ldquo;but is it really important?&amp;rdquo; question. I could not find any mention of this variability issue, and only lots of highly significant p-values.&amp;nbsp; What is actually the best explanation of these students&amp;rsquo; evolutionary understanding?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today. Tomorrow. Every day. Because it requires attention year round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the start of the semester is an appropriate time to bring up this study by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Levecque and co-authors&lt;/a&gt;, covered in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/phd-students-face-significant-mental-health-challenges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, that focuses on graduate students. It quantifies the problem, but also identified consistent predictors of mental health issues:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;work-life conflicts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;high job demands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;low job control&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The story I come up with based on these results is that low job controls leads to (a perception of) high job demands, to work-life conflicts, to mental health symptoms. And what could be related to low job control and/or high job demands? Maybe supervisor style, which can either diminish the prevalence of mental health issues when it is perceived as inspirational, or increase when it is perceived as laissez-faire. This again stresses the crucial importance of the supervisor-graduate student relationship, one of the recurrent themes in these news items.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another recurrent theme in these news items is the importance of reasonable job expectations, potentially non-academic ones. It is thus maybe not a coincidence that &amp;ldquo;Positive perception of career outside academia&amp;rdquo; has a strong positive effect on graduate mental health. If you know that all the hard work will eventually lead to a satisfying job that requires this education, and not necessarily a low probability faculty position after an endless series of postdocs, maybe that makes all the hard work worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Career preparation for graduate students.</title>
      <link>/post/career-preparation-for-graduate-students./</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/career-preparation-for-graduate-students./</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an important issue, and I have already spent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cottenielab.org/search/label/grad%20school&#34;&gt;4 news items on this&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177035&#34;&gt;recent publication in PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt; investigated some of the strategies and resources PhD students (and postdocs) use for non-academic jobs. This is very important because more than 80% of our graduate students end in these non-academic jobs (although these numbers also includes MSc students). I should not have been surprised, but there are sociological theories and active research programs around this issue, resulting in publications where I am only comfortable reading the abstract and discussion, and hoping that the reviewers did their job. The crux from the results section to me was this section:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;Interestingly, our results also show that a trainee’s perception of high program support for career goals had direct and significant effects on their career development search efficacy, while perceived advisor support was not significant at all. It may be that perceived program support for career goals enables trainees to develop a broader support base within their graduate programs (as opposed to being driven by dissatisfaction with one’s advisor).&lt;/blockquote&gt;This presents a glass half full/empty perspective on career preparation: a grad student readiness does not depend on an advisor&amp;rsquo;s experience that will vary wildly between faculty members, but more on the support provided by the department/college/university. And since universities are explicitly tasked to prepare their graduates for the job market, there is some incentive to address any shortcoming institutionally. The question, of course, still remains if Integrative Biology and the university as a whole provides sufficient support. So is your glass half full, or half empty? Let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reviewers should (also) be paid by publishers</title>

      <guid>/post/reviewers-should-also-be-paid-by-publishers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stephen Heard touched on a controversial issue in his latest blog post: &lt;a href=&#34;https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/can-we-stop-saying-reviewers-are-unpaid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Can we stop saying reviewers are unpaid?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;This (contrarian?) point of view resulted in some push-back in the comments, and on other blogs (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opiniomics.org/lets-keep-saying-it-and-say-it-louder-reviewers-are-unpaid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s keep saying it, and say it louder: REVIEWERS ARE UNPAID&lt;/a&gt; by Mick Watson). I agree with most of Stephen Heard&amp;rsquo;s points, and also with his updated point &amp;ldquo;publishers (mostly) don&amp;rsquo;t pay for reviews&amp;rdquo;. Where I disagree with him (there has to be at least one disagreement, because why otherwise waste digital bandwidth on writing this?), is that &amp;ldquo;reviewers are (mostly) paid&amp;rdquo; is actually an important admission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggled to find a useful analogy to explain my unease with his admission, and it suddenly dawned on me. Several years ago, I read a blog post by Alex Bond on &lt;a href=&#34;https://labandfield.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/why-volunteer-field-techs-are-a-bad-idea/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Why volunteer field techs are a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;. I hope I summarize their (further developed with Auriel Fournier in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.603/full&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that received a lot of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://labandfield.wordpress.com/2016/03/09/volunteer-field-techs-are-bad-for-wildlife-ecology-the-response/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt;) arguments&amp;nbsp;correctly with these points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;it is an essential part of the research process, so it should be rewarded accordingly;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;not paying reduces the field tech&amp;rsquo;s value, and thus &amp;ldquo;the professionalism of science as a whole&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;prevents underprivileged scientists from participating;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;financial restrictions, tradition, and CV building for the field techs are not good enough justifications in light of these criticisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;The analogy with peer review is immediately obvious in the first line: it is an essential part of the scientific process, so it should be rewarded. Stephen Heard&amp;rsquo;s argument is that reviewers are being rewarded (paid). What the analogy with volunteer field techs exposes, though, is that it is important to look at who benefits from the work. In the field tech case, it is first the scientist who got funding for the study that benefits from the volunteer work, and then in a second step science as a whole. In the peer review case, what I think Stephen Heard overlooks is that publishers benefit first, and science as a whole only in a second step.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And this benefit to publishers is important. A recent Science paper by Gretchen Vogel and Kai Kupferschmidt report on a quick back-of-the-envelop type of calculation:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Collectively, the world&amp;rsquo;s academic libraries pay some €7.6 billion in subscription fees for access to between 1.5 million and 2 million new papers annually, or between €3800 and €5000 per paper, according to an estimate by the Max Planck Society.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;While the net benefit to the publishers will be lower, of course, nobody can argue that publishers do not benefit directly from the reviewers. And publishers do not pay reviewers, directly or indirectly. Yes, society as whole pays scientists partly for their many contributions, but eliminating the publishers from that argument is wrong. If we make the analogy with the volunteer field tech case again, that would be similar to imagining a PI flush with money saying that she will not pay her field tech because the &amp;ldquo;pay&amp;rdquo; provided by the experience will improve his CV and his changes for a scholarship or job. Or more succinctly: Volunteer field techs are (mostly) paid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If that above scenario raises some problems, then arguing that reviewers are (mostly) paid, is not the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; statement to ponder. If you agree that in the above scenario that the field tech should receive monetary compensation for his contribution (or be paid) from the PI, and that that is the important debate, then I think that &amp;ldquo;reviewers should (also) be paid by publishers&amp;rdquo; is the more important debate to have.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since starting these news items, we have discussed themes related to mental health issues, their causes, and some solutions. Ardon Schnorr, a Biology PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University wrote a very powerful article around this theme that touches on a lot of issues surrounding this problem: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chronicle.com/article/Grad-School-Is-Hard-on-Mental/240626&#34;&gt;http://www.chronicle.com/article/Grad-School-Is-Hard-on-Mental/240626&lt;/a&gt;. It is a must read for any graduate student. And if you are inspired by the positive effects of science communication, but do not know where to start, you can always start with the University of Guelph &lt;a href=&#34;http://outreach.letstalkscience.ca/uguelph.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk Science outreach program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Problem in R: how to create a .Rprofile that does not hide important information ...</title>
      <link>/post/problem-in-r-how-to-create-a-.rprofile-that-does-not-hide-important-information-.../</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:44:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/problem-in-r-how-to-create-a-.rprofile-that-does-not-hide-important-information-.../</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; but still is specific to each R script file. For instance, a lot of R users in our group load their packages at the top of their R scripts. Often, these packages are the same, but sometimes they add a different one for a specific type of analysis. I use the tidyverse all the time, and in some analyses vegan. A school of thought would be to automatically add these package to the start up using a .Rprofile file. Others would argue that this makes the code less reproducible, since some essential pieces of information are hidden from the R script file. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if you could have both? All the boilerplate stuff such as loading packages at the top of each R script file, but execute them automatically when you open that script file? I think I have found a solution to that mythical beast. I googled for it, but could not find anything similar, so that is why I provide my code here. Hopefully somebody else will find this useful, or point me to other, more elegant, solutions that I can incorporate in my own code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to create a generic but specific profile file that reads the beginning of each R file &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;Copy this profile file either in your home directory or in each working directory. A quick google on .Rprofile and your OS will help you out for the advantages/disadvantages of these two approaches. However, I created this profile file to ensure that it will read all your script files within a folder, and execute them until it finds the line &amp;ldquo;# Startup ends here&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume that this will be mainly for loading libraries, so I specified the script to only read the first 30 lines, but you can increase/decrease this for your coding practices. I also made it recursive, so it will read all the script files within the folder structure, but you can change this too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have also added some encouragement, that has the secondary objective that you can see if the .Rprofile code worked correctly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find the code here on github:&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/karl-cottenie/kc-.Rprofile&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/karl-cottenie/kc-.Rprofile&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/karl-cottenie/kc-.Rprofile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Snippet usage &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;This works nicely with the new snippet I created. In RStudio &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; code &amp;gt; Edit Snippets&amp;hellip; copy the lines below, and save the updated snippets file. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;snippet stup &lt;br /&gt;############################## &lt;br /&gt;## ${1:title}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;## &lt;br /&gt;## Karl Cottenie &lt;br /&gt;## &lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;r paste(&amp;quot;##&amp;quot;, Sys.Date())&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;## &lt;br /&gt;############################## &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;library(${2:package}) &lt;br /&gt;# Add as much code here that you want to execute each time your script file is loaded. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;# Startup ends here&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you type &amp;ldquo;stup&amp;rdquo; at the beginning of a file, it will paste the above code, you can add the title of your script file, and when you press your tab key the cursor will jump to the library command, and you can for instance add tidyverse, or ggplot, or whatever you normally use. The snippet will automatically add the date, of course you can/should change the author :-) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Problems with my code, other options? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;Just let me know, because there are probably edge cases I did not think about, and more elegant solutions that I will not find on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous 2 blog posts, I discussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cottenielab.org/2017/04/graduate-student-well-being.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some sobering figures on the graduate experience&lt;/a&gt;, and how this is probably (partially) related to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cottenielab.org/2017/04/the-thorny-subject-of-assessing.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lack of advisor evaluation &lt;/a&gt;(and training?). And then I read this column from naturejobs.com &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7648-129a&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;A growing phobia&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The author, with &amp;ldquo;30-plus years as faculty member&amp;rdquo; experience, proposes his (I assume a white man wrote this) solution to a student&amp;rsquo;s fear of interacting with their advisor: &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;But if you are the student, understand that these meetings benefit you, and that it is your responsibility — not your supervisor&amp;rsquo;s — to set them up. You need to be able to organize your thoughts, rethink experiments, present experimental results and interpretations and consider your next steps. These skills will make supervisor meetings less frightening and more useful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So no mention of how the advisor can help the graduate student with the underlying causes of this fear? Because there are some clues scattered throughout the blog post:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The supervisor, with the best of intentions, provides constructive criticism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;remarking on the slow progress of one PhD student&amp;rsquo;s research project at our second review meeting&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Three months later, I repeated my concerns&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;rdquo; I was too busy to notice for another six months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was horrified when my suggestion elicited tears.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ideally, your supervisor will be empathetic until you can acclimatize to feedback and criticism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Maybe I am reading too much into these comments, but look at the accompanying artwork: towering, stern male figure vs cowering grad student. The student does not fear the criticism per se, but the supervisor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how can we (supervisors, advisors, professors) create an environment that does not create this fear? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-classroom-management/wont-ask-us-help/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;This recent article reports on a survey done in an undergrad setting&lt;/a&gt;, but the conclusions are equally applicable to graduate advising, I think. Some of the facilitators are difficult to change or impractical (&amp;ldquo;Professor has good personality&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Professor gives their phone number&amp;rdquo;), and some of the suggested facilitators are behaviours that are difficult to quantify or change, such as encouraging, caring, inviting and open, willing or eager to help. But some suggestions are very practical and, if grad student interactions are important to you, relatively easy to implement (I added the bold to certain words):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Professor uses and &lt;b&gt;answers&lt;/b&gt; email&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Professor has many and &lt;b&gt;flexible&lt;/b&gt; office hours&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Professor has &lt;b&gt;accessible&lt;/b&gt; office hours&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;And doing these things would show the student that you care. When you are too busy to notice the absence of one of your own students for six months, maybe it is no wonder that a student does not feel important or valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

Jennifer recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://hdl.handle.net/10012/11756&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;finished her MSc&lt;/a&gt; with where she looked at aquatic macroinvertebrate community composition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Northern Prairie Pothole Region (NPPR) of Alberta, Canada contains numerous shallow marshes that serve as important habitat for wildlife and provide many essential ecosystem services. Many of these pothole wetlands have been destroyed or degraded by agricultural activity, prompting research into their condition and management. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are frequently used as indicators of environmental condition in rivers and lakes, but their effectiveness as indicators in prairie pothole marshes is not clear. I discovered that, contrary to my predictions, macroinvertebrate richness and community composition at family-level resolution do not respond to land use. Instead, macroinvertebrate community composition in pothole marshes is structured primarily by hydroperiod, which ranges from temporary, through seasonal and semi-permanent, to permanent marsh classes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;After her undergrad degree, she worked at BIO, and for her PhD she will combine both expertises (molecular identification and macroinvertebrate community composition) to investigate anthropogenic influences at the landscape scale. Very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am slowly finding my way through the mystery that is twitter. The interface seems so inaccessible to me, everything so tightly bunched up, with lots of symbols, and &amp;nbsp;secret conventions that are almost Dan Brown masonic in nature. If you need to google how to interact with twitter and find articles like &lt;a href=&#34;http://readwrite.com/2014/08/21/twitter-jargon-illustrated-rt-mt-canoes-darth/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, either I am getting old or the organic development of twitter needs a redesign/reboot (or both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more and more people are using it in a science context, so I feel the need to get on the bandwagon, or at least know where the bandwagon is going, and how to get on and off quickly. So I decided to highlight 5 tweets that got my attention, where insightful, or captured some poignant moment from the CSEE meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;The only &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/spatial?src=hash&#34;&gt;#spatial&lt;/a&gt; pattern that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSEE2017?src=hash&#34;&gt;#CSEE2017&lt;/a&gt; couldn&amp;rsquo;t predict was the # of people interested in the talk on predicting spatial patterns &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/A0aA4H3Z1Q&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/A0aA4H3Z1Q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Carolyn Trombley (@CaroTrombley) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CaroTrombley/status/861649882318118913&#34;&gt;May 8, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Carolyn&amp;rsquo;s tweet is especially funny, because if you look closely, you can see Bob Holt, one of the founding fathers of spatial ecology, looking in from the outside ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script async=&#34;&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34; src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-partner=&#34;tweetdeck&#34;&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AnneKSalomon&#34;&gt;@AnneKSalomon&lt;/a&gt; thinks through her predictions for clam recruitment into ancient clam gardens on the beach &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/inspiration?src=hash&#34;&gt;#inspiration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSEE2017?src=hash&#34;&gt;#CSEE2017&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CSEE2017&#34;&gt;@CSEE2017&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/si1rU1cZ3F&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/si1rU1cZ3F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Norah Brown (@norahebrown) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/norahebrown/status/861765473301446656&#34;&gt;May 9, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Anne Salomon&amp;rsquo;s public talking skills are summarized in this one picture from her presentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script async=&#34;&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34; src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-partner=&#34;tweetdeck&#34;&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;Delighted to introduce &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AnneKSalomon&#34;&gt;@AnneKSalomon&lt;/a&gt; to give the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSEE2017?src=hash&#34;&gt;#CSEE2017&lt;/a&gt; public lecture on ecological surprises and social-ecological systems&lt;/div&gt;— Isabelle M Côté (@redlipblenny) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/redlipblenny/status/861759043550957569&#34;&gt;May 9, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Isabelle Côté&amp;rsquo;s introduction was in rhyme, a first for me and a lot of CSEE members I think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script async=&#34;&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34; src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-partner=&#34;tweetdeck&#34;&gt;&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;A general reminder: There are other fish in the Pacific than salmon.. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSEE2017?src=hash&#34;&gt;#CSEE2017&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/f7Qiw3sZlx&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/f7Qiw3sZlx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;— Isabelle M Côté (@redlipblenny) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/redlipblenny/status/861628383888723968&#34;&gt;May 8, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Mild?)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something we have known for the last 10 years (or 20) through for instance the research done by Eric Mazur and collaborators.&lt;a href=&#34;http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.1374249&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; They showed&lt;/a&gt; that using peer instruction improved student learning of physics concepts by 20% in a real-world, class setting, compared to a &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; lecture-based approach with the sage on the stage imparting their wisdom to the young susceptible minds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gmbGhFvxS6s/WQmtr0YTf3I/AAAAAAABfZI/VFdpMXO3arQ6-lScbkXPhmqkuGVj7iA6gCLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B6.10.37%2BAM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gmbGhFvxS6s/WQmtr0YTf3I/AAAAAAABfZI/VFdpMXO3arQ6-lScbkXPhmqkuGVj7iA6gCLcB/s320/Screenshot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B6.10.37%2BAM.png&#34; width=&#34;312&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That is a fine example of a very deliberate teaching practice. Sometimes the learning is much more &amp;hellip; unexpected. In Winter 2017, I organized a graduate course called &amp;ldquo;Ecological statistics through time&amp;rdquo; that was mainly student taught, by design. I will devote some blog posts on some of these experiences, but one of the fun outcomes was something I did not (could not) anticipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The students in the course had a wide range of experience with R, from 3+ years of daily coding for a MSc degree to just one undergrad intro stats course. This made teaching R a challenge, because I had to constantly try and accommodate these extremes (with varying levels of success probably). But the advantage was that I had plenty of best practice examples that did not come from me, but from their peers. For instance, I have collected and created some best practice documents for R coding in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cottenielab.org/p/projects.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Resource page on my website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what is not on this page, and what a lot of students had fun with for their final reproducible coding assignment, was something that they learned from Joey. He and Sharon posted some R code for their discussion, and it had this header:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCXkmb9Co18/WQnY-qJJkfI/AAAAAAABfZ0/C52Ib_7CaeMHmaQv_cTmSOdBLeHrd5iUQCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.18.26%2BAM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;45&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCXkmb9Co18/WQnY-qJJkfI/AAAAAAABfZ0/C52Ib_7CaeMHmaQv_cTmSOdBLeHrd5iUQCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.18.26%2BAM.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And this style showed up in some modesty in their peers&amp;rsquo; code:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_2fTM1_0gsE/WQnY-esOdCI/AAAAAAABfZk/B8iBihAotK4lGLSNJVtoWci0dwmTDowWwCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.09.25%2BAM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;48&#34; src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_2fTM1_0gsE/WQnY-esOdCI/AAAAAAABfZk/B8iBihAotK4lGLSNJVtoWci0dwmTDowWwCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.09.25%2BAM.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some also went to town with this idea, and went beyond expectations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iivXtro_eFw/WQnY-VupgRI/AAAAAAABfZs/PkZAfX01cyEO07pvCfcdFcG0plIK5FWYQCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.10.26%2BAM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;201&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iivXtro_eFw/WQnY-VupgRI/AAAAAAABfZs/PkZAfX01cyEO07pvCfcdFcG0plIK5FWYQCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.10.26%2BAM.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DbeA7xya1wg/WQnY-qQ3V5I/AAAAAAABfZw/iZefQKr3VrAV3VlJG9pbJVLSrgLmrN7DgCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.12.36%2BAM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DbeA7xya1wg/WQnY-qQ3V5I/AAAAAAABfZw/iZefQKr3VrAV3VlJG9pbJVLSrgLmrN7DgCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.12.36%2BAM.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And it is hard to pick the best one, but this is one of my favourites:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RaqUR6r1XrY/WQo2k3g6jSI/AAAAAAABfaM/nG3vjJdMYQI81rP_a3LF33fOlf7JdpwmACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B3.58.22%2BPM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;125&#34; src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RaqUR6r1XrY/WQo2k3g6jSI/AAAAAAABfaM/nG3vjJdMYQI81rP_a3LF33fOlf7JdpwmACLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B3.58.22%2BPM.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most satisfying aspects of graduate school is working together with graduate students to solve fun, important, novel problems. This &amp;ldquo;working together&amp;rdquo; can cover the gradient from supervisor, to advisor, mentor, and collaborator. However, from the perspective of a graduate student, the leadership style implied by these different terms can have important effects on graduate student well-being (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cottenielab.org/2017/04/graduate-student-well-being.html&#34;&gt;last week&amp;rsquo;s news item&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422&#34;&gt;one of the mentioned articles&lt;/a&gt;, the authors explicitly quantified three different leadership styles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Turning to the leadership style of the PhD supervisor, we see evidence for a better mental health in those PhD students who are advised by a professor with an inspirational leadership style (OR is 0.868 for GHQ2+ and 0.908 for GHQ4+). No significant associations were found between an autocratic leadership style and the experience of mental health problems. However, when PhD students were exposed to a laissez-faire leadership style, the risk of experiencing psychological distress significantly increased.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The university spends a lot of time to discussing how to assess undergraduate teaching, but assessing graduate advisors has received a lot less attention. And now there is strong evidence that this assessment has important, positive consequences. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/assessing-phd-supervisors-leads-higher-completion-rates&#34;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; reports on results from a study at eight research universities that concluded that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;tr_bq&#34;&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; was a much more effective system for classifying and tracking the performance of supervisors. This has led to problems being addressed earlier, the removal of “totally unsatisfactory supervisors” and an 8 per cent increase in timely completions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The assessment criteria were: the current and past number of students advised, graduations within the completion period, and &amp;ldquo;student rescues&amp;rdquo;. While these are relatively easy to quantify, they do not necessarily address some of the aspects covered in the first quote. This would involve graduate student (past and present?) input, and this is where the thorns come into the picture. Because of the close nature of the advisor-graduate student relationship, what would you ask, when would you ask this, and who would you ask it to?&lt;/p&gt;
